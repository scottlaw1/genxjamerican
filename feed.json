Alabama and Mississippi have also chosen this day to celebrate Robert E. Lee, the general who led the Confederate army in the very first insurrection against the federal government.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I did not bother to \"bear witness\" to the travesty of inaugurating a convicted felon and thief of classified information. Instead, I <a href=\"https://www.contrabandcamp.com/p/what-to-do-when-your-country-finds\">read Michael Harriot</a>, who encouraged us \"Do not die\" in a nation which has made clear it wants us to. I read the eloquent words of Rod Serling about Dr. King after he was assassinated from a letter he wrote to the LA Times on April 8, 1968 (h/t to <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/lizzslockeroom.bsky.social\">@lizzslockeroom.bsky.social</a>).  Here is an excerpt (also <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/840804-in-his-grave-we-praise-him-for-his-decency--\">available on goodreads</a>):</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In his grave, we praise him for his decency - but when he walked amongst us, we responded with no decency of our own.  When he suggested that all men should have a place in the sun - we put a special sanctity on the right of ownership and the privilege of prejudice by maintaining that to deny homes to Negroes was a democratic right.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now we acknowledge his compassion - but we exercised no compassion of our own.  When he asked us to understand that men take to the streets out of anguish and hopelessness and a vision of that dream dying, we bought guns and speculated about roving agitators and subversive conspiracies and demanded law and order.  We felt anger at the effects, but did little to acknowledge the causes.  We extol all the virtues of the man - but we chose not to call them virtues before his death.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And now, belatedly, we talk of this man's worth - but the judgement comes late in the day as part of a eulogy when it should have been made a matter of record while he existed as a living force.  If we are to lend credence to our mourning, there are acknowledgements that must be made now, albeit belatedly. We must act on the altogether proper assumption that Martin Luther King asked for nothing but that which was his due ... He asked only for equality, and it is that which we denied him.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today is just day one of a years-long parade of indignities this country--especially those in its marginalized communities--will suffer.

The tech industry I've worked in since before Facebook ever existed didn't treat people who weren't white and male very well for decades before that.  DEI efforts across the tech industry were largely belated, token efforts at most companies, that didn't meaningfully increase the diversity of rank-and-file employees or leadership.  Meta retreating from DEI feels like yet another slap at black folks who have already endured far more than enough between the death of affirmative action in higher education, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/nx-s1-5108729/fearless-fund-atlanta-grant-program-shut-down-lawsuit\">a legal settlement that literally prevents black people from giving away their own money</a> to black women the rest of the venture capital industry ignores, the outcome of the presidential election, and everything else that comes along with what we should have left behind from Trump's first term.

My Mastodon server (hachyderm.io) <a href=\"https://community.hachyderm.io/blog/2025/01/09/defederation-from-threads/\">administrators opted to defederate from Threads</a> in the interest of protecting their users who are part of marginalized communities.  I expect many other Mastodon instances of varying sizes to follow suit, or apply some moderation to Threads accounts.  Deleting other Meta accounts (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) is much harder than deleting Threads because of how many meaningful relationships I have with people that social media makes it easier to maintain.  Perhaps this will be a year of seriously seeking alternatives--and making more efforts to connect in real life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

With <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/daniel-penny-subway-chokehold-jordan-neely-305a4eb324f6466a67bdb6734a7b999a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">their acquittal of Daniel Penny on the charge of criminally-negligent homicide</a> in his killing of Jordan Neely, impunity is what the jury granted him.  Jordan Neely was lynched for having a mental health crisis while black, poor, and homeless.  A jury of Daniel Penny’s peers showed him the mercy that he didn’t show Jordan Neely.  It didn’t matter that that Penny’s Marine instructor testified that he executed the hold incorrectly. It didn’t matter that at least one passenger is on video warning Penny that his chokehold was going to kill Neely. It didn’t matter that Neely had no weapon and didn’t harm anyone on the train before Penny literally choked the life out of him.  The video of Neely being asphyxiated is a modern-day lynching postcard now. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m old enough to remember watching video footage of Rodney King being beaten within an inch of his life on video.  I remember watching broadcasts of the destruction that resulted from people enraged by the verdict (and some opportunists too). Fast-forward almost 30 years and one of Ahmaud Arbery’s lynchers leaked the video of his crime thinking it would help him.  He and his co-conspirators will likely spend the rest of their natural lives in prison.  Video of George Floyd’s excruciating death under the knee of Derek Chauvin will keep the man in prison for nearly 2 decades from now. But just 4 year later, a vigilante can strangle a man to death with impunity. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My cynical mind wonders how the jurors who acquitted Daniel Penny responded to the broad daylight murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.  Perhaps the response to his murder (which has included very dark jokes and applause on social media) and the response to Neely’s lynching are two sides of the same coin. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Either way, we are (and have been for far too long) a nation too comfortable with violence, too numb to the suffering of those who are most often its victims.  This puts everyone in a marginalized community at greater risk—not just from police (who will operate with even greater impunity than they already had once the second Trump administration begins), but now apparently from white vigilantes also. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Like the trial of those who lynched Ahmaud Arbery, the only reason there was a trial at all was some public outcry that Penny was initially released without charges after he was first questioned by police.  While Penny is also charged with criminally negligent homicide,  the maximum sentence for a conviction on that charge is just 4 years.  It's also possible (if not probably) that the jury will will show Penny the mercy he lacked for Jordan Neely and find him not guilty--despite video evidence of him slowly but surely squeezing that man's life out of him.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the time since I first wrote A Nation Without Mercy, the \"active and ongoing dehumanization and criminalization of the poor and mentally-ill\" has continued.  <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/06/28/nx-s1-4992010/supreme-court-homeless-punish-sleeping-encampments\">The conservative majority on the Supreme Court ruled that cities can ban people from sleeping and camping in public</a>--even if the cities offer no alternative shelter.

But in a result even worse than 2016, he won the popular vote--a feat he failed to achieve in two previous runs for the White House.  Votes are still being counted as I write this, so we don't have a full picture of the final outcome, but it seems likely that the GOP will control all three branches of the federal government again.  Trump appears to not have grown his vote totals from 2020 much at all--but some 11 million fewer people voted for Kamala Harris this cycle than voted for Joe Biden four years ago.  To the extent there is any silver lining in this election wipeout, my home state is sending its first black senator to Washington, along with keeping my House representative Jamie Raskin in his seat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every post-mortem of Kamala Harris' loss that I've read sucks--<a href=\"https://thegrio.com/2024/11/07/why-kamala-harris-lost-explained/\">except Michael Harriot's</a>.  It seems that black people in this country are nearly alone in believing in the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr for racial equality in this country--and that is why we are going back.  The only question which remains to be answered is \"how far back?\"  The Trump rally in Madison Square Garden before the the election suggests a return to the 1930s, when the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2017/06/american-nazis-in-the-1930sthe-german-american-bund/529185/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2017/06/american-nazis-in-the-1930sthe-german-american-bund/529185/\">pro-Nazi German-American Bund</a> met openly and freely in New York, New Jersey, and elsewhere before World War II began.  Trump (and JD Vance's) blood libel of law-abiding Haitian migrants in Ohio and elsewhere and their campaigning on mass deportation and border camps sets this country's return destination to the 1950s, and <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/operation-wetback-eisenhower-1954-deportation\">Operation Wetback</a>--the largest mass deportation in this country's history.  We can be certain that the same administration which birthed the child separation policy at our southern border--a policy that years later has left hundreds of children growing up with strangers, separated from their real parents--will devise a sequel to Operation Wetback which makes the original look humane by comparison.  <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/how-trump-will-change-immigration-migration-mass-deportation-muslim-ban-tps-daca/\">The end of birthright citizenship</a>--another part of Trump's xenophobic plans--along with the return of the Muslim ban of his first term intimates a return to an 1860s United States after the Civil War but before the ratification of the 14th Amendment.  This is just a small sample of the threats which await in the future.  We don't know if the Affordable Care Act will survive.  We don't know if the Department of Education will survive--along with the oversight and mandates it provides which ensure that my son gets support in public school for his special needs.  We don't know what will become of the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or any other federal agency responsible for protecting Americans from threats to their physical or financial health.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From January 20, 2025 onward, things will change.  The coming days, weeks, and months will bring negative impacts that Trump's non-wealthy supporters did not anticipate.  Tariffs are certainly returning, along with the inflation that comes from companies increasing their prices to maintain their profit margins.  I'm good on the appliances front myself, but I might be upgrading more of my personal technology earlier than I planned to avoid the price increases that tariffs will bring.  The mass deportation plans, possible Affordable Care Act repeal, and other aspects of Project 2025 may create infighting, backlash, and enough pain nationwide to create a small window to mitigate some of the damage in 2026--if elections remain a thing we still have in this country.  That hope may be a dangerous thing, but I will nurture it nonetheless. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite these future threats, I have decided to focus more on the present.  What can I do <strong>today</strong> to make sure I'm ok, that my wife and kids are ok, and that the people who matter to me are ok?  Answering those questions and doing as many of those things as possible, and repeating that cycle the day after that is what I can do.  In addition, I can figure out what I can do <strong>beyond voting</strong> to make the spaces I inhabit and have influence in a little better.  It may not be much, but it feels like a more productive and sustainable alternative than despair.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Below is a short clip from the speech:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"[youtu.be/gvI6fgdxI...](https://youtu.be/gvI6fgdxI-Y?si=K0-gCCyCw1F8gzDR)\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n[youtu.be/gvI6fgdxI...](https://youtu.be/gvI6fgdxI-Y?si=K0-gCCyCw1F8gzDR)\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">3 minutes, 38 seconds of Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, speaking to an audience at Hunter College, in New York City in 1983</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Political views aside, one thing that is clear from this brief clip is that Bishop's concept of blackness was an <strong>inclusive </strong>not an <strong>exclusive </strong>one.  If the raucous response of his black American audience is any indication, they were very much onboard with what he was saying.  Bishop gave another speech in D.C. the same year to the Sixth Annual Dinner of TransAfrica.  The <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://jpanafrican.org/docs/vol10no3/10.3-19-MBishop.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi1pq_s9tmHAxUMq4kEHX9fBSIQFnoECBMQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0430kc1T5_0rBk7-pWeQoz\">full text of his remarks</a> are quite enlightening to read this many years later.  He notes the Caribbean heritage of a number distinguished black Americans--but puts their black Americanness in the forefront.  A few of the names I will touch on later in this piece are all people whom ADOS/FBA would gatekeep out of blackness.  To continue briefly with Grenada and its American connections, it is very important to talk about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Little\">Louise Little</a>.  She is known as the mother of <strong>Malcolm X</strong> (so by the logic of ADOS/FBA he's not black), but only when researching this piece did I learn that she was first introduced to Garveyism and the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in Montreal by her uncle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Garveyism is a flavor of black nationalism named for <strong>Marcus Garvey</strong>, a Jamaican immigrant to the U.S.  UNIA was the black nationalist organization he founded.  His separatist views were at odds with the pro-integration aims of the NAACP (and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Negro-Hat-Rise-Marcus-Garvey/dp/0195393090\">Colin Grant's biography of Garvey</a> suggests that he and W.E.B. DuBois hated each other), but UNIA's presence grew enough to span 25 U.S. states (and attract the unwanted attention of J. Edgar Hoover).  <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/garvey-washington/\">Garvey was inspired by Booker T. Washington</a>, and was among the <a href=\"https://archives.lib.duke.edu/catalog/washingtonbookercorr\">people Washington corresponded with via letters</a>.  Garvey wanted to found a school in Jamaica like Tuskegee but Washington died months before Garvey would come to the U.S. to discuss his plans.  During and after his 52 years of life, his ideas would influence black nationalism, the black power movement, and Pan-Africanism, the ideas which ultimately inspired Malcolm X in similar ways to his parents.  Garvey's concept of blackness too was <strong>inclusive</strong> rather than <strong>exclusive</strong>.  <a href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/foundations-black-power\">After Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, <strong>Kwame Ture</strong> (previously known as Stokely Carmichael) would raise the mantle of black power</a>.  Ture hailed from Trinidad, so by ADOS/FBA logic, <strong>John Lewis' successor as chair of SNCC</strong> was not black.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Garvey was far from the only West Indian to contribute to blackness in America in the early 20th century.  Alain Locke's 1925 anthology <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/the-new-negro-and-the-dawn-of-the-harlem-renaissance/\">The New Negro</a>, a key work heralding the Harlem Renaissance, contained numerous works by black authors from Jamaica (Claude McKay and Wilfrid A. Domingo), British Guiana (Eric Waldron), and Puerto Rico (Arturo Schomburg).  <a href=\"https://daily.jstor.org/black-caribbeans-in-the-harlem-renaissance/\">Nearly one in four members of Harlem's black residents were foreign-born</a> in the 1920s.  Looking back into the 19th century and the Civil War, we find that <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/the-54th-massachusetts-infantry\">the black volunteers of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry regiment</a> hailed not only from states in the Union and slave states, but from the Caribbean and Canada as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Contrary to the narrow and exclusive concept of blackness that ADOS/FBA advocates, black student groups protested apartheid in South Africa in the 1970s, many years before the likes of <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/meet-conservatives-who-campaigned-apartheid-south-africa/\">Grover Norquist, Jack Abramoff, Jeff Flake</a> were fighting movements to boycott, divest, and sanction it (and after <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/apartheids-useful-idiots/282114/\">William F. Buckley, the intellectual father of the modern right, turned from advocating for apartheid domestically to advocating for it overseas</a>).  ADOS/FBA's narrow and exclusive concept of blackness continues to be ignored by law enforcement in this country.  Amadou Diallo (killed by plainclothes NYPD officers) was a student from Guinea.  Botham Jean (murdered by his neighbor, police officer Amber Guyger) was from St. Lucia.  I suspect more research would confirm that black immigrants are at just as much from police violence as black folks with solely American heritage. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many first-generation immigrants (like my parents) have long since become citizens--and lived in the United States far longer than they ever did in their country of origin.  <strong>Harry Belafonte</strong> was born in New York City, but his parents came from Jamaica.  <strong>Colin Powell</strong> had both Jamaican parents and a New York City birthplace in common Belafonte.  Many children of first-generation immigrants (like me) have black American wives and children.  The late General Powell's wife Alma (who passed away late last month) was originally from Alabama.  My wife and in-laws hail from Columbus, Ohio, with a lineage that stretches back to Tennessee and Mississippi.  Among their relatives is a now-deceased Tuskegee Airman who lived in Kansas.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Regardless of the desires and efforts of those in this country who wish to define blackness as something small and exclusive to those whose heritage is solely the United States, the history and the present of this country makes blackness a little larger.  Having a heritage that includes a Caribbean island or a birthplace on the African continent does not make us any less black.  Donald J.

We have seen incels with guns engage in mass shootings before, with women as their primary victims.

I'm talking about the reaction to the debate rather than the debate itself because I didn't watch it. Debates are not the same as governing, and what the Biden administration has accomplished legislatively (rather than just through executive orders) is more than enough to merit a second term. The immediate aftermath of the debate was filled with panic, both in my social media feeds and among friends I talk to regularly. The chattering class at the New York Times ran to fill their opinion columns with calls for Biden to resign (calls they very notably did not make when Donald Trump was convicted on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records). What I most noticed about every single panicked replacement plan I saw posed in social media is that they all involved stepping over Kamala Harris, the current Vice President of the United States who also happens to be a black woman (as well as southern Asian, on her mother's side).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you call out liberals on this, you tend to get responses that look like this one:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p></p><blockquote class=\"bluesky-embed\" data-bluesky-uri=\"at://did:plc:apu4byoq44zyjzrau4ig3v4c/app.bsky.feed.post/3kw3bnbybzc27\" data-bluesky-cid=\"bafyreicjhodgsj6gv6lqef5stlwsk2leurri6hmmmmsngklftlv4muf6am\">\n<p lang=\"en\">This is utter horseshit because if Michelle Obama was running you wouldn’t hear any of this.

As such, the idea among many hair-on-fire panickers about Biden's poor debate performance that they should simply replace Biden (and his vice president) with someone else that can beat Trump is not surprising. One proposed replacement, Pete Buttigieg (currently secretary of transportation), ran for president before and had his candidacy fail in large part because of a lack of connection to and interest in black voters and our issues. I haven't looked deeply at other prospective replacements regarding their connections to and interest in engaging black voters (in addition to other demographics), but the small percentage of black voters they represent suggests that they haven't had to care about black voters to win elections. The speed with which the powers-that-be in the party suggested that Biden be cast aside after the bad debate suggests to me a desire to no longer be beholden to black voters (and our interests) in the way Biden quite clearly is because his primary campaign was on life support before South Carolina and Jim Clyburn's intervention and now he is president.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Seth Moulton might be the best current representatives of the middle of a Democratic Party for whom the existence of black voters is an hindrance to his goal of having the party change its focus by \"talk about [Biden's] bipartisan wins, like the infrastructure bill\".  Particularly when the GOP marches in lockstep behind the convicted felon who currently leads them, the insistence of Moulton's fellow \"centrists\" on bipartisanship dooms good policy to defeat. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/20/us-child-poverty-doubled-in-2022-thanks-to-joe-manchin-we-must-reverse-course\">Joe Manchin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/gallego-sinema-child-tax-credit\">Kyrsten Sinema</a> prevented the child tax credit from being expanded, erasing the gains made in the reduction of child poverty--which helped everyone while it was in place, including black folks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>According to Moulton, his party colleagues have <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/06/trump-biden-2024-seth-moulton/678744/\">\"lost the middle\"</a> due to Biden's push for student-loan debt relief and \"identity politics\".  When I looked up the demographics of the congressional district Seth Moulton represents, it turns out to be not only one of the whitest congressional districts in the country, but also rather well-off financially on average.  It's quite revealing of a so-called centrist to point to \"identity politics\" as why the Democrats have supposedly lost the middle in an environment where the Supreme Court has made affirmative action in higher-education illegal and conservative school boards in so-called red states are busily banning books by and about black people.  Despite not treating black people as a constituency to be respected, the Seth Moultons of the Democratic Party will be the first ones to turn around and blame us when his party loses elections they think they should win.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This isn't to suggest that the Biden administration has been an unambiguous plus for the black community either.  While he did choose Kamala Harris as his vice president and nominated Ketanji Brown-Jackson to be the first black woman on the Supreme Court, along with passing economic recovery legislation that helped reduce unemployment among black people to the lowest level on record, he hasn't succeeded in reviving the Voting Rights Act from its nearly-dead state (thanks to judicial overreach from the conservative activists who sit on the Supreme Court).  Biden has also been relentless pro-police, despite <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/violent-crime-falling-nationwide-heres-how-we-know\">decreasing rates of violent crime</a>, and despite the disproportionate <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/police-violence-killings-black-sleep-taser-bb99923245505557c90d305d2cc3990d\">impact of police violence on black communities</a>.  And that's before you get to the prior years of his political career which included mishandling the hearings which would ultimately result in Clarence Thomas being elevated to the Supreme Court, co-sponsoring a crime bill that paved the way for decades of mass incarceration of black folks, and legislation that stripped student borrowers of bankruptcy protections--which would ultimately be shown to disproportionately impact black borrowers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The \"indifference, unless it's an election year\" approach of national Democrats is obvious enough that the GOP has made it part of their pitch to black voters. But a GOP approach that veers between the cartoonish (such as <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/pitch-black-voters-trump-emphasizes-amazing-mugshot-rcna159205\">Trump's continuing insistence on the appeal of his mugshot to black voters</a>), the insulting (<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4214596-ramaswamy-sparks-furor-with-comments-on-race/\">literally anything Vivek Ramaswamy says</a>), the dishonest (<a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/tim-scott-2024-presidential-campaign-drop-out-rcna124928\">Tim Scott pretending that systemic racism doesn't exist</a>), and <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/impact-voter-suppression-communities-color?ref=bad-faith-times.ghost.io\">voter suppression</a> manages to be even worse. Any messages they might try to put forward about values, or fiscal responsibility, or entrepreneurship are largely undermined by Trump's corrupt business dealings, nepotism on behalf of his incompetent children, and his unconvincing attempts to even pay lip service to the idea of Christianity mattering even a little bit to him personally.  But in the debate where Biden performed poorly, Trump may have managed to hit a new low even for him by warning both during the debate and a recent campaign rally that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trumpblackjobsdebatebiden-7c520492a34fa902028ed4537d48cdb0\">migrants are taking \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs\" from Americans</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Predictably, we took \"black jobs\" and ran with it for fun on Black Twitter <a href=\"https://x.com/hashtag/BlackJobs?src=hashtag_click\">#BlackJobs</a>, to flip Trump's nasty xenophobia into a way to highlight the variety of different work we do in this country. Sadly, given the disrespect I've observed and personally experienced online directed at black immigrants who are naturalized U.S. citizens or who have parents from abroad, there is definitely a small segment of black Americans Trump will succeed in attracting to his camp with xenophobia. Nor will I rule out the possibility of xenophobia succeeding in attracting a small number of Hispanic Americans.

Whether they recognize it or acknowledge it or not, the GOP we see today is one that to a man (and virtually all of them are men) that they helped create.  On their watch, the GOP changed into a party that embraced the vision of Pat Buchanan and rejected the \"kinder, gentler\" conservatism of George W. Bush which despite the many flaws of his presidency (both foreign and domestic) managed to appeal to enough voters to win the popular vote in 2004, including <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2005/06/27/iv-how-latinos-voted-in-2004/\">between 40 and 44% of Hispanics</a>.  So while they have predictably joined the chorus of panic that would push Biden out in favor of some mythical moderate candidate who would appeal to enough of the electorate to beat Donald Trump, they are operating from the same Seth Moulton perspective that sees black voters and our issues as a inconvenience.  They may oppose Donald Trump, but their views of black voters don't appear to be much more sophisticated than his.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So these are the choices of black voters--a Democratic Party that takes our votes and interests for granted, or a GOP who would rather suppress our votes and divide them than compete for them.

Three students were killed, 28 wounded in the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/1960s/orangeburg-massacre\">Orangeburg Massacre</a>.  To add insult to injury, the few policemen actually brought to trial for their actions were all acquitted.  Cleveland Sellers--one of the shooting victims--was falsely convicted of rioting at the bowling alley and served jail time.

The stark differences in when (and against whom) government power is used undermines the idea that concern about antisemitism is the main reason.

It seems far more likely that the university bowed to internal and external pressure from groups advocating on behalf of Israel expressing concerns about Asna Tabassum's social media activity.  The USC Shoah Foundation, with whom Tabassum worked with as part of her minor in \"resistance to genocide\", <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/usc-shoah-foundation-distances-itself-from-canceled-pro-palestinian-valedictorian/\">has distanced itself from her, via the words of a spokesperson</a>.

The cancellation of Tabassum's speech has since snowballed into the cancellation of its main stage commencement ceremony.  As of today, even the smaller ceremonies individual colleges were set to have may be at risk with two scheduled speakers, <a href=\"https://san.com/cc/usc-commencement-speakers-pull-out-after-valedictorian-speech-cancellation/\">C Pam Zhang and Safiya Noble pulling out in protest</a> of the cancellation of the valedictorian's speech and calling LAPD on campus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One unexpected bright spot in this season of failing to live up to ideals is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/04/26/dc-police-george-washington-university-protests/\">the DC Police Department, who rejected the request of George Washington University leaders</a> to clear an on-campus encampment of a small number of protestors.  HBCUs have not shown up in any news I've seen regarding protests of the war, and beyond calls for peace <a href=\"https://thehilltoponline.com/2023/10/23/among-the-hbcu-community-support-for-israelis-and-palestinians-has-historical-ties/\">there are numerous reasons for relative silence from leaders of those institutions</a>.  While my wife and I are nearly a decade away from higher education decisions for our twins, how a university's leadership chose to treat students and faculty in this moment will factor significantly into my decisions regarding where to send them.  If the recent past teaches us anything, it is that those who stood up for the marginalized and oppressed in the face of government power stood on the right side of history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Governor Moore's response to Bash's initial question was the right one in my view, because he dismissed the Republican assertions as foolishness and talked about closure and comfort for the families of those killed in the accident, safety for first responders, re-opening the channel and port, and rebuilding the bridge.  Bash persisted in asking the governor about the \"DEI mayor\" insult against Baltimore mayor Brandon Scott by someone from the blue check brigade on Twitter.

There is of course no actual evidence that DEI had anything to do with a ship the size and the weight of a skyscraper plowing into the bridge and destroying it.  So why would Dana Bash waste air time elevating the ignorant nonsense of GOP pols spewing racism on Twitter?  My guess is that CNN wanted to appear \"balanced\", but they failed at that in addition to wasting the governor's time and that of their viewers.  What does a Utah state representative have to say that could possibly be relevant to the issue at hand?  As it turned out, absolutely nothing.  What does a former member of the Florida House of Representatives have to say that could be relevant?  Again, absolutely nothing.  Remember--six people died as a result of this accident.  As of this writing, some of the dead still have not been recovered.  A key driver of economic vitality for the city and the state is now at risk.

That's time which could have been spent asking about potential future changes in policies and procedures for handling large cargo ships in the future.  It could have been used to ask about the victims of the accident, who merited only a brief mention from Bash at the end of the interview.  It could have been used for a deeper dive into <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/30/1241539966/baltimore-port-workers-unemployed-key-bridge-collapse\">the local economic impacts of the accident on the Port of Baltimore</a>, and on the people who work there.  Many port workers live in <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/dundalkcdpmaryland/PST045223\">Dundalk, MD</a>, a place that differs quite a bit demographically from what racists on Twitter seem to think.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/watch/baltimore-bridge-disaster-being-blamed-by-leading-republicans-on-dei-decried-by-baltimore-mayor-207843909663\">Joy Reid's interview with Mayor Scott</a>, even while calling out the conspiracy theories around the accident as ridiculous, did surface the very same tweets from the fever swamp as Dana Bash did.  Mayor Scott took the opportunity to respond to the racist assertions from Twitter, which is his right.  But a large part of me wishes that he had followed the governor's example and left the foolishness of the right-wing fever swamps to Black Twitter.  Because if there's anything Black Twitter does well, it's turn insults on their head.  Since DEI is the new n-word, here is a small sampling of what's been done with it:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2774,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.genxjamerican.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-06-at-8.13.11%E2%80%AFPM-1024x371.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2774\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2775,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.genxjamerican.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-06-at-8.14.58%E2%80%AFPM-1001x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2775\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In my view, journalism continues to let social media be their assignment editor and set the agenda.  Whether would-be centrists like CNN or <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/04/1242294070/baltimore-key-bridge-mayor-brandon-scott-racist-attacks\">NPR</a>, or overtly left-leaning MSNBC, Twitter still figures far too prominently in their coverage and in their questions.  Particularly when the owner of Twitter has made it his mission to platform Nazis and personally amplify the most offensive and extreme right-wing thoughts, integrating the worst output of such a platform into news coverage cannot help but make the news product worse, and less useful to us as citizens.  Difficult as it is to find conservative perspectives on issues that are actually useful, the press needs to make the effort.  Racist positions are not owed airtime simply because they are \"the other side\".  In researching this post, I found <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brandon-scott-baltimore-mayor-face-the-nation-transcript-03-31-2024/\">Ed O'Keefe of CBS' Face the Nation did the same thing Dana Bash did when he interviewed Mayor Scott</a>.

Not only do they not represent Baltimore, they would probably be lucky to be able to find the city on a map.  They don't have relevant expertise in shipping or ports or bridge-building or disaster response.  Don't be the journalist who makes a conversation worse by bringing voices to it that have nothing to add beyond ignorance and racism.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Social media has been predictably filled with derisive commentary from so-called conservatives about the black governor of the state, Wes Moore, not wearing a suit during a 3 am press conference responding to the disaster.  They've called Brandon Scott a \"DEI\" mayor, ignoring the fact that he was elected by a majority of the citizens of Baltimore in 2020.  Right-wing pundits have blamed everything from COVID to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-maria-bartiromo-immigration-b2519268.html\">border policy</a> for the bridge collapsing--nevermind the fact that any bridge hit by something the size and weight of a skyscraper was going to fall down.

She isn't the first former RNC chair NBC has hired.  Michael Steele remains a political analyst today for MSNBC, in addition to hosting his own podcast and other endeavors.

His arms and legs were thick. His mouth peeked out from two ballooning cheeks. He moved slowly.</p>\n<p>Throughout his toddler years, Gustun had regularly asked his parents to refill his bottle with his favorite “milk” — a type of formula made especially for kids his age. And they were happy to oblige. Sumet Aunlamai and Jintana Suksiri, who lived in a rural province north of Bangkok, had carefully chosen the brand.</p>\n<p>Like other Thai parents, they’d been bombarded by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->formula advertising on television<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, online and in grocery stores, where a rainbow of boxes and canisters of powdered toddler milk featured teddy bears in graduation caps and giveaways like toys or diapers. It cost far more than cow’s milk but promised to make Gustun stronger and smarter.</p>\n<p>What Jintana didn’t know, as Gustun chugged the formula and his weight neared 70 pounds, was that her son’s choice drink had sparked an international feud.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Thai health experts tried to stop aggressive advertising for all formula — including that made for toddlers. Officials feared company promotions could mislead parents and even persuade mothers to forgo breastfeeding, depriving their children of the vital health benefits that come with it. At the time, Thailand’s breastfeeding rate was already among the lowest in the world.</p>\n<p>But the $47 billion formula industry fought back, enlisting the help of a rich and powerful ally: the United States government.</p>\n<p>Over 15 months, U.S. trade officials worked closely with formula makers to wage a diplomatic and political pressure campaign to weaken Thailand’s proposed ban on formula marketing, a ProPublica investigation found.</p>\n<p>U.S. officials delivered <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a letter to Bangkok<!-- raw HTML omitted --> asking pointed questions, including whether the legislation was “more trade restrictive than necessary.” They also lodged criticisms in a bilateral trade meeting with Thai authorities and on the floor of the World Trade Organization, where such complaints can lead to costly legal battles.</p>\n<p>Thai officials argued the new regulation would protect mothers and babies. In the end, though, the Thai government backed down. It banned advertising for infant formula but allowed companies to market formula for toddlers like Gustun — one of the industry’s most profitable and dubious products. The final law also slashed penalties for violators.</p>\n<p>“Our law is really weak and enforcement is really weak,” said Dr. Siriwat Tiptaradol, who championed the proposed ban as a former adviser to Thailand’s health minister, in an interview in Bangkok. “I was upset and disappointed.”</p>\n<p>The U.S. endeavor in Thailand was part of a decadeslong, global effort to protect the United States’ significant formula production and export business. ProPublica reviewed thousands of pages of emails and memos by U.S. officials, letters to foreign ministries, correspondence from industry groups and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->academic research<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We also interviewed health experts and government leaders in nearly two dozen countries, including former U.S. officials.</p>\n<p>Together, the reporting shows the U.S. government repeatedly used its muscle to advance the interests of multinational baby formula companies, such as Mead Johnson and Abbott, while thwarting the efforts of Thailand and other developing countries to safeguard the health of their youngest children.</p>\n<p>Just last March, at a meeting in Dusseldorf, Germany, U.S. officials opposed a reference to formula advertising bans in a new international food standard for toddler milk. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The move<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came <!-- raw HTML omitted -->after indust<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ry lobbying<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>At the center of many efforts was the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which advises the president on trade policy. Emails show its staff in regular contact with formula makers and their industry groups through meetings, calls and position papers — which the industry used to hammer its objections to regulations around the world. “Mead Johnson and other infant formula producers have been very vocal, expressing concerns to the Thai and U.S. governments about what they feel is the imminent passage of this measure,” U.S. officials wrote in 2016 as Thailand considered its formula marketing ban.</p>\n<p>Officials with the USTR and other trade-focused agencies, including those within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, then echoed those positions in communications with other countries or in international forums like the WTO, the documents showed.</p>\n<p>“The U.S. is highly influential,” said Dr. Robert Boyle, a doctor at Imperial College London who has researched international formula use.</p>\n<p>In many places, the lobbying appeared to succeed. Hong Kong, for example, watered down some of its formula regulations after objections from U.S. trade officials, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->who said in a draft letter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the rules “could result in significant commercial loss for U.S. companies.” And a proposal in Indonesia stalled after questions from the U.S. at the WTO.</p>\n<p>Notably, such advocacy has not only hindered local attempts to stop formula marketing that critics say is misleading or even predatory, but it has also undermined the work of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->U.S. foreign aid and health officials<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who have long supported breastfeeding across the globe. They call it “one of the highest returns on investment of any development activity” because of its well-documented benefits for babies’ health and cognitive growth.</p>\n<p>“I think it is shocking,” said Jane Badham, an independent nutrition consultant and expert in child feeding who works internationally. “One doesn’t realize how much this kind of interference is happening.”</p>\n<p>The meddling broke into public view in 2018, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->when officials from the Trump administration<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were accused of threatening to withhold military aid from Ecuador if the country didn’t drop its proposed resolution in support of breastfeeding at the World Health Organization; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the U.S. ambassador later denied<!-- raw HTML omitted --> making threats. But ProPublica’s investigation found that the scope of the interference far exceeded that incident and continues today under the Biden administration. In fact, Ecuador and Thailand were just two stops on a worldwide crusade against regulation that has spanned Republican and Democratic presidential administrations and touched more than a dozen countries, including South Africa, Guatemala and Kenya, as well as Southeast Asian nations such as the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>\n<p>Neither Abbott nor Mead Johnson responded to requests for interviews or to detailed questions from ProPublica. The latter’s parent company, Reckitt, also did not respond to our request for comment.</p>\n<p>USTR officials declined to be interviewed for this story. In response to written questions, an agency spokesperson said in a statement that under President Joe Biden, the trade agency has emphasized respecting the role of foreign governments in deciding the appropriate regulatory approach, including with respect to infant formula. USTR has been committed “to making sure our trade policy works for people — not blindly advancing the will of corporations,” the statement said.</p>\n<p>That has meant moving the office “away from the formerly standard view that too often deemed legitimate regulatory initiatives as trade barriers,” the spokesperson said, adding that the move has “enervated” corporate players who have been used to “getting their way at USTR for decades.”</p>\n<p>The spokesperson, however, declined to provide examples of the new approach in relation to formula. She also declined to respond to questions about government documents that show the trade office under Biden working with other federal agencies to pursue the same playbook on formula as prior administrations.</p>\n<p>In 2021, for example, officials complained to Filipino trade authorities about stricter formula marketing rules they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->considered “overkill,”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and expressed fears about regulatory “spillover” elsewhere in Southeast Asia. In Kenya, they sought to strike a provision in a proposed formula advertising ban after an industry group sent USTR a paper seeking its deletion.</p>\n<p>Public health officials are increasingly raising concerns about toddler milk, especially as companies deploy advertising for products using bold — and, critics say, often unsupported — health claims.</p>\n<p>In October, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a new report warning about the marketing for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->toddler formula<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. “Products that are advertised as ‘follow-up formulas,’ ‘weaning formulas’ or ‘toddler milks and formulas’ are misleadingly promoted as a necessary part of a healthy child’s diet,” said Dr. George Fuchs III, a lead author of the study. The drinks are worse than infant formula for babies under 1 year, he said, and “offer no benefit over much less expensive cow’s milk in most children older than age 12 months.”</p>\n<p>Unlike infant formula, toddler milks are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Nutrition experts have warned about hefty doses of sweeteners and sodium in some brands.</p>\n<p>The Infant Nutrition Council of America, a formula industry group, defended toddler drinks, saying they “can contribute to nutritional intake and potentially fill nutrition gaps for children 12 months and older.”</p>\n<p>Toddler milk made up just 11% of all formula sales in the United States in 2023, but it was much more popular abroad, according to Euromonitor, which tracks sales data. Worldwide, it made up 37% of sales. In Thailand, it accounted for more than half.</p>\n<p>The country is now struggling to address the consequences of the law’s weakening, researchers and officials say. More than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 in 10 Thai children<!-- raw HTML omitted --> under 5 years old face what researchers call a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“double burden of malnutrition”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that leaves some struggling with obesity and others lagging behind growth targets. Increased breastfeeding could help address both problems.</p>\n<p>“You go to school and see a lot of kids are overweight,” said Dr. Somsak Lolekha, president of the Royal College of Pediatricians of Thailand and the Pediatric Society of Thailand. “We have a big problem in Thailand.”</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The warning dates to 1981, when the nations that make up the governing body of the WHO passed the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes. It aimed to stop all promotion of drinks meant to replace breast milk.</p>\n<p>The move followed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reports in the 1970s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that thousands of infants in impoverished countries were falling ill and dying after drinking formula.</p>\n<p>Not only were mothers using costly formula to replace breast milk, which would have given their babies better immunity, but the water parents mixed milk powder with was sometimes contaminated, leading to life-threatening bacterial infections and diarrhea. Overdiluted formula was causing severe malnutrition, too. Activists called for a boycott of the world’s biggest formula maker, Nestlé, which had heavily promoted its products in developing countries.</p>\n<p>During the height of the controversy, an average 212,000 babies in low- and middle-income countries died preventable deaths linked to formula use annually, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an academic paper circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research<!-- raw HTML omitted --> estimated last year. (Nestlé disputed the research and said it was the first formula company to incorporate the WHO recommendations into its marketing policy in 1982.)</p>\n<p>The United States cast the sole “no” vote against the international code, with the Reagan administration citing First Amendment protections on advertising. The Washington Post quoted a senior federal official who resigned over the decision, saying it would be “seen in the world as a victory for corporate interests.”</p>\n<p>To be sure, formula was crucial for babies who didn’t have access to breast milk. But for those who did, public health experts feared aggressive advertising and free samples would derail a critical cycle. Once babies start drinking formula regularly, research shows, their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mothers’ breast milk supply can drop<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>“The evidence is strong,” <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a WHO and UNICEF report<!-- raw HTML omitted --> explains. “Formula milk marketing, not the product itself, disrupts informed decision-making and undermines breastfeeding and child health.”</p>\n<p>In the years since the international code was adopted, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at least 144 countries<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have sought to enshrine its voluntary restrictions into laws that bar formula marketing in stores, hospitals and elsewhere. Despite poor enforcement in many places, the laws have had measurable benefits. Studies have shown that countries that adopted marketing bans <!-- raw HTML omitted -->saw their breastfeeding rates rise<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and more breastfeeding is in turn linked to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fewer infant deaths<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It also reduces mothers’ risk of certain cancers.</p>\n<p>Baby formula manufacturers responded to slower growth in infant formula sales by creating products for older babies and toddlers — age groups that fell outside most regulations.</p>\n<p>“We have a proven global demand-creation model,” Greg Shewchuk, Mead Johnson’s head of global marketing, told investors in 2013. “Capture baby very early on, often before it’s born, hold onto them through feeding and their feeding challenges and extend them as long as possible.”</p>\n<p>Mead, which was based in the United States until a British company bought it in 2017, termed the strategy A-R-E: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Acquisition, Retention, Extension<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>To make toddler products more attractive to parents, who usually just gave their kids cheaper cow’s milk beginning at age 1, formula makers began adding nutritional supplements like DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish and algae with purported benefits for brain and eye health.</p>\n<p>The claims, however, are unproven. Studies have found no definitive link between babies’ brain and eye development and DHA supplementation, a 2017 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->meta-analysis of 15 studies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> found, according to Cochrane, a nonprofit that supports systematic reviews of health research. In fact, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->breastfed babies perform<!-- raw HTML omitted --> better on intelligence tests.</p>\n<p>Still, formula companies used additives like DHA “as a hook to expand their market share,” said Peter Buzy, CFO and treasurer of Martek Biosciences Corp., which produced DHA, at an analysts’ meeting in 2004. “Really targeting, you know, the sippy cups of the world.”</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the Infant Nutrition Council of America defended the health and nutrition claims, saying they “are based on science and medical research and meet all legal, regulatory and nutritional science requirements.”</p>\n<p>The marketing worked. Toddler milk has overtaken infant formula in worldwide sales, according to Euromonitor. Global toddler milk sales have grown by 25% since 2013, to almost $20 billion. A little less than two gallons of toddler milk can cost $30 or more, compared with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->around $3.94<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a gallon for regular milk in the U.S.</p>\n<p>For formula manufacturers, the popularity of the product had another benefit: It helped them circumvent local rules against marketing infant formula. By using similar logos, colors or fonts across product lines, legal advertisements for toddler milk effectively promoted baby formula too, even in places where it was subject to a marketing ban. Nutrition experts and advocates called the tactic “cross-promotion.”</p>\n<p>During the past decade, sales of regular infant formula grew about 10% worldwide, to $15 billion.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The family lived in military housing in Lopburi, a rural province two hours north of Bangkok whose capital city is world famous for its flourishing monkey population. With Sumet serving in the Army, Jintana took time off from her job in customer relations to care for the newborn.</p>\n<p>She breastfed Captain until it was time to return to work three months later. The couple shopped for formula. Health claims formula makers listed on packages were “very important,” Sumet said through a translator. They settled on a product called Dumex that promised to strengthen Captain’s brain, immunity and eyes. It was made by the French giant, Danone, which boasts that the brand <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“has happily raised generations of Thais.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Millions of women like Jintana had been entering the workforce in developing regions such as Southeast Asia. The big six transnational companies that make most of the world’s baby formula saw this as a boon.</p>\n<p>For Mead Johnson, the maker of Enfamil, the benefits of developing economies were twofold. “Firstly, in most countries, breastfeeding is incompatible with women participating fully in the workforce,” CEO Kasper Jakobsen said in a 2013 earnings call. “And, secondly, as women participate in the workforce, that creates a rapid increase in the number of dual-income families that can afford more expensive, premium nutrition products.”</p>\n<p>By then, Thailand was Mead’s fifth-biggest market worldwide. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Southeast Asia was well on its way to becoming more important <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to the formula industry than the U.S. and European markets combined.</p>\n<p>As business boomed, advocates lambasted the industry for its practices. Mead employees, for example, allegedly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bribed<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> health care workers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at government hospitals in China so they would recommend the company’s formula to new mothers — charges the company ultimately resolved with a $12 million settlement in 2015; the company did not admit or deny regulators’ findings in the agreement. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Danone faced similar allegations from Chinese media<!-- raw HTML omitted --> related to the brand Captain and Gustun drank, Dumex. Danone said at the time that it accepted responsibility for the lapses and suspended the program involved, according to the BBC.</p>\n<p>The industry maintained close relationships with the medical establishment in Thailand, too. One pediatrician and advocate for breastfeeding, Dr. Sutheera Uerpairojkit, told ProPublica that two decades ago, she saw formula companies offer doctors and medical staff trips abroad in exchange for giving patients free samples and collecting their data. Some took the trips. Sutheera did not participate.</p>\n<p>Thailand adopted the international code in 1984 — but only as a voluntary measure. Over the years, Siriwat and others pushed for tougher formula marketing restrictions without success. In one meeting, he and colleagues at the Thai health ministry pressed formula companies to comply with the voluntary rules, which they’d routinely broken. The businesses resisted. “One company said, ‘If I do not violate, I cannot compete with other companies,’” Siriwat recalled in September.</p>\n<p>“That makes me very angry,” he said, remembering how he stormed out of the room.</p>\n<p>By 2014, with Thailand’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->breastfeeding rate at only 12%<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, according to one survey, Siriwat persuaded the health minister to seek legislation to formally ban marketing infant and toddler formula. He wanted the new law to include enforcement and penalties for violators.</p>\n<p>The WHO, a United Nations agency promoting health, wanted more countries to pursue such measures. Its staff in 2016 released new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recommendations on ending the promotion of formula products<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for toddlers, as well as infants. In theory, that guidance could help countries like Thailand fend off trade complaints about new marketing bans. And an endorsement by the WHO’s member nations would underscore the recommendations’ importance.</p>\n<p>But public health wasn’t the only concern as nations prepared to vote.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Industry groups scrambled to arrange meetings with high-level officials in Washington. “Clearly, the potential economic and international trade implications from this proposed draft guidance are quite significant,” the pro-industry Infant Nutrition Council of America said in a letter to an FDA official in 2016.</p>\n<p>That year, companies and trade groups connected to commercial milk formula, including Abbott Laboratories and Nestlé, spent almost $7 million lobbying U.S. officials about WHO matters, after a decade in which their lobbying disclosures had not mentioned the organization at all, a study found.</p>\n<p>The industry’s outreach spanned Washington. The Infant Nutrition Council of America, for instance, lobbied the Senate, House and USTR — as well as the commerce, state, agriculture and health departments, lobbying records show. The efforts attracted the attention of leaders in both parties, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called President Barack Obama about the issue, according to records obtained by ProPublica.</p>\n<p>Inside the administration, USTR took up the formula industry’s cause. “USTR does not support issuance of the guidance or resolution” on toddler milk, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote Jennifer Stradtman, a USTR official<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in an email to other federal officials. Furthermore, she wrote, her office “will not be able to accept” any resolution that encouraged WHO member countries to convert any of the guidance into law.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t the first time the USTR sided with industry despite public health concerns: In 2013, a group of Democratic senators scolded <!-- raw HTML omitted -->U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for a proposal to help tobacco companies use trade law to “subvert” tobacco control measures — a stance the lawmakers called “deplorable and a serious threat to global public health.”</p>\n<p>In the debate over toddler milk, officials from Froman’s office repeatedly questioned science, prompting a fight with public health officials, internal documents show.</p>\n<p>In one exchange, then-USTR lawyer Sally Laing objected to a sentence from the guidance that said research suggests food preferences are established early in life.</p>\n<p>“Unsupported,” Laing wrote.</p>\n<p>Health officials pushed back on that, as well as other USTR edits. “MUST NOT DELETE,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protested in all caps, arguing that key language in the resolution was, in fact, backed by scientific evidence. But such concerns appeared to get lost in the debate, as those sentences were ultimately struck from the text.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as WHO member nations gathered to vote in Geneva, formula lobbyists had U.S. officials “on speed dial” and urged them to weaken the WHO resolution, said Jimmy Kolker, who led the negotiations for the U.S. as an assistant secretary in the Health and Human Services Department.</p>\n<p>And the industry’s agents appeared to have inside knowledge. A baby-formula industry association lobbyist cornered Kolker. “From her approach, it was obvious to me that she had been forwarded an internal, very-limited-distribution USG email,” he wrote in an email to other U.S. government officials. “This is unacceptable and makes our job as negotiators significantly more difficult.”</p>\n<p>In the end, the United States delegation persuaded WHO nations not to “endorse” their staffs’ own recommendations. Instead, the body voted only that it “welcomes with appreciation” the guidance — language that undercut its utility. The resolution, lacking the weight of an official endorsement, left many nations puzzled over whether it would help neutralize trade complaints.</p>\n<p>“That has caused a lot of confusion,” said Laurence Grummer-Strawn, a WHO official who focuses on child feeding and former nutrition chief for the CDC. “What does that really mean?”</p>\n<p>Stradtman and Laing could not be reached for comment. Froman did not respond to requests for comment, and a USTR spokesperson declined to comment on the office’s actions during the WHO debate. In a general statement, the spokesperson said that “with regard to infant formula, USTR, in conjunction with others in the interagency, work to uphold and advocate for policy and regulatory decisions that are based on science.”</p>\n<p>The practical impact of the resolution’s weakened wording became clear within months, when the U.S. and other dairy producers like Australia and Canada accused Thailand of attempting to obstruct trade with its marketing ban. Thai officials argued their country had a “strong need for a regulation,” saying the “sales promotion” of milk formula for babies and toddlers contributed to the nation’s low rate of breastfeeding. But when it referenced the WHO’s guidance and resolution to support its position at the WTO, the U.S. countered that those measures did not amount to “an international standard.”</p>\n<p>When the Thai National Legislative Assembly finally passed its formula marketing measure in April 2017, the provisions that the U.S. and its allies — plus some Thai doctors and industry lobbyists — had complained about most loudly were either watered down or gone entirely. Lawmakers had reduced the maximum criminal penalty for violations from three years in prison to one year in prison and the maximum fine from about $8,730 to $2,910, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a USDA document shows<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>The law banned the marketing of infant formula and outlawed cross-promotion, but it still allowed advertising on products for 1- to 3-year-olds.</p>\n<p>At a June 2017 meeting of the WTO, the U.S. called the changes “a welcome modification.”</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The couple diligently followed the “stages” prescribed by Dumex, which came in a cheery red package: Stage 1 formula when Gustun was an infant, Stage 2 when he was an older baby and Stage 3 when he became a toddler. He craved formula, and his parents, believing it was healthy, always gave him more. By the time he was 3, he reached his peak weight of about 66 pounds — the same as an average<!-- raw HTML omitted -->9-year-old<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. He was drinking six or seven bottles a day, each holding about 12 ounces of toddler milk.</p>\n<p>Jintana wasn’t worried at first as Gustun grew pudgy. His brother, Captain, had been big, too — almost 60 pounds — at the same age. But when Gustun started school in person after the pandemic, his teachers were concerned. They had seen others arrive, as one put it, “addicted to the bottle.” The weight slowed Gustun down during movement time, his teacher Tida Rakrukrob said through a translator. “He would move slowly and was less active compared to other children,” she said.</p>\n<p>When another teacher posted <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a video<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on TikTok showing herself comforting and talking with Gustun one day, it went viral — receiving 732,000 likes and many comments about how cute he was. But his teacher’s concern with his difficulty moving led his parents to bring him to see a doctor, who tested him for a hormone imbalance and checked him for diabetes. The tests came back negative. The parents reduced the fried food, dessert and snacks Gustun ate.</p>\n<p>The biggest change the family made, though, was eliminating toddler formula from his diet. His school gave him cow’s milk instead, as it did for other children.</p>\n<p>Gustun’s extra weight began to disappear.</p>\n<p>Looking back, Jintana said she thinks he gained so much “because of the toddler milk.”</p>\n<p>Today at age 6, Gustun is no longer on a restricted diet — he can eat fried food and dessert — and weighs 35 pounds, about half of what he weighed at the peak of his Dumex consumption. He is more outgoing at school, Jintana said, and plays soccer with his older brother every day. Captain lost a similar amount of weight after switching to cow’s milk at school and is now 9 and slim, weighing around 51 pounds.</p>\n<p>One Monday in September, the brothers — both in soccer jerseys — kicked a ball back and forth in the driveway of the family’s brightly painted red house. Gustun, who has a lightning bolt shaved into his hairline, chased the ball and tried to get it away from his brother, who darted about quickly, tapping it from foot to foot.</p>\n<p>“Now, his movement is perfect,” his mother said.</p>\n<p>Danone, the company that makes Dumex, said in a statement that while breast milk offers children the best nutritional start, “50 years of scientific research into nutritional needs in early life underpins our products, and we do not make claims that have not been backed up by scientific research.” The company said that research has shown that toddler milk can provide nutrition and help improve the diet of children age 1 and older, reducing the risk of iron and vitamin D deficiency.</p>\n<p>“We encourage parents to follow the guidelines on pack when using our products, which are carefully calibrated so that babies and infants receive the right amount of nutrients they need each day from our products,” the company said.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Indeed, at two supermarkets in Bangkok, shiny walls of powdered formula boxes seven shelves high greeted shoppers on a warm day in September. There were few differences between packages for products intended for babies and those intended for toddlers.</p>\n<p>Formula makers and stores offered steep discounts for toddler milk, calling one a “Mommy Fair Shock Deal.” An offer on one shelf told parents if they spent about $87 on Hi-Q1 toddler formula, made by Danone, they could receive a free yellow and blue swing set worth about $27. Other offers included a clay “pizza dough cooking fun set,” a toy keyboard and microphone, and even a pushable “speedcar trolley” that a toddler could sit in.</p>\n<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2022 study<!-- raw HTML omitted --> led by Nisachol found 227 instances of formula marketing that violated the law.</p>\n<p>The government has levied fines for violations, but Thailand’s health ministry doesn’t name offenders. “The tactic is ‘I will violate your law,’” Siriwat said, “‘and prepare the budget for the fine.’”</p>\n<p>Thai health authorities have tried to fight back by raising parents’ awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding. The health ministry, for example, erected billboards saying “breast milk is medicine” and called doctors to a meeting to urge them to promote breastfeeding among their patients. But these campaigns are no match for the formula companies’ massive spending on marketing, Siriwat said.</p>\n<p>While Thailand’s exclusive breastfeeding rate for babies six months or younger rebounded to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about 29% in 2022<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, UNICEF found, it is still far short of the WHO’s target of at least 50% by 2025. The country’s rates of obesity and stunting for children 5 and under are higher today than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they were in 2016<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the year before the watered-down formula law passed.</p>\n<p>Dr. Somsak Lolekha, president of the Thai pediatric society, said formula isn’t the only reason for children’s weight problems. But it plays a big role, he said, because it’s so easy to drink — a point that tracks with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->studies showing that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> babies who breastfeed longer are less likely to become obese and develop diabetes than those who drink formula.</p>\n<p>Last summer, Thailand joined more than 100 nations at the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva to explore ways to fight unethical formula marketing. Attendees sat at long tables in a sleek, modern auditorium. Like other nations’ representatives, Dr. Titiporn Tuangratananon, an official with Thailand’s health ministry, declared her intentions on brightly colored paper posted at the front of the room: “Fully control” the marketing of formula to young children, and “Increase + expand enforcement.”</p>\n<p>In an interview, Titiporn said health officials are trying to update the country’s marketing rules — including making some forms of toddler formula advertising, such as giveaways, discounts and free samples, illegal.</p>\n<p>But that could ultimately prove difficult in a country that is now the seventh-largest market in the world for formula.</p>\n<p>In fact, according to Titiporn, the government has already been deluged by public comments critical of its regulatory efforts. She suspected the pro-marketing remarks, some of which had been repeatedly copied and pasted, came from representatives of the formula industry.</p>\n<p>“We know that it’s not real,” Titiporn said. “It’s not the real mothers.”</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

His arms and legs were thick. His mouth peeked out from two ballooning cheeks. He moved slowly.\n\nThroughout his toddler years, Gustun had regularly asked his parents to refill his bottle with his favorite “milk” — a type of formula made especially for kids his age. And they were happy to oblige. Sumet Aunlamai and Jintana Suksiri, who lived in a rural province north of Bangkok, had carefully chosen the brand.\n\nLike other Thai parents, they’d been bombarded by <a href=\"https://accesstonutrition.org/app/uploads/2020/01/BMS_thailand_2018-release_statement_pdf.pdf\">formula advertising on television</a>, online and in grocery stores, where a rainbow of boxes and canisters of powdered toddler milk featured teddy bears in graduation caps and giveaways like toys or diapers. It cost far more than cow’s milk but promised to make Gustun stronger and smarter.\n\nWhat Jintana didn’t know, as Gustun chugged the formula and his weight neared 70 pounds, was that her son’s choice drink had sparked an international feud.\n\nIn 2017, Thai health experts tried to stop aggressive advertising for all formula — including that made for toddlers. Officials feared company promotions could mislead parents and even persuade mothers to forgo breastfeeding, depriving their children of the vital health benefits that come with it. At the time, Thailand’s breastfeeding rate was already among the lowest in the world.\n\nBut the $47 billion formula industry fought back, enlisting the help of a rich and powerful ally: the United States government.\n\nOver 15 months, U.S. trade officials worked closely with formula makers to wage a diplomatic and political pressure campaign to weaken Thailand’s proposed ban on formula marketing, a ProPublica investigation found.\n\nU.S. officials delivered <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24040045-fas-letter#document/p8/a2428242\">a letter to Bangkok</a> asking pointed questions, including whether the legislation was “more trade restrictive than necessary.” They also lodged criticisms in a bilateral trade meeting with Thai authorities and on the floor of the World Trade Organization, where such complaints can lead to costly legal battles.\n\nThai officials argued the new regulation would protect mothers and babies. In the end, though, the Thai government backed down. It banned advertising for infant formula but allowed companies to market formula for toddlers like Gustun — one of the industry’s most profitable and dubious products. The final law also slashed penalties for violators.\n\n“Our law is really weak and enforcement is really weak,” said Dr. Siriwat Tiptaradol, who championed the proposed ban as a former adviser to Thailand’s health minister, in an interview in Bangkok. “I was upset and disappointed.”\n\nThe U.S. endeavor in Thailand was part of a decadeslong, global effort to protect the United States’ significant formula production and export business. ProPublica reviewed thousands of pages of emails and memos by U.S. officials, letters to foreign ministries, correspondence from industry groups and <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/series/Breastfeeding-2023\">academic research</a>. We also interviewed health experts and government leaders in nearly two dozen countries, including former U.S. officials.\n\nTogether, the reporting shows the U.S. government repeatedly used its muscle to advance the interests of multinational baby formula companies, such as Mead Johnson and Abbott, while thwarting the efforts of Thailand and other developing countries to safeguard the health of their youngest children.\n\nJust last March, at a meeting in Dusseldorf, Germany, U.S. officials opposed a reference to formula advertising bans in a new international food standard for toddler milk. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24427116-isdi-formula-lobbying-dusseldorf#document/p2/a2428446\">The move</a> came <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24486081-2023-ustr-two-pages#document/p2/a2441969\">after indust</a><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24486081-2023-ustr-two-pages#document/p2/a2441969\">ry lobbying</a>.\n\nAt the center of many efforts was the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which advises the president on trade policy. Emails show its staff in regular contact with formula makers and their industry groups through meetings, calls and position papers — which the industry used to hammer its objections to regulations around the world. “Mead Johnson and other infant formula producers have been very vocal, expressing concerns to the Thai and U.S. governments about what they feel is the imminent passage of this measure,” U.S. officials wrote in 2016 as Thailand considered its formula marketing ban.\n\nOfficials with the USTR and other trade-focused agencies, including those within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, then echoed those positions in communications with other countries or in international forums like the WTO, the documents showed.\n\n“The U.S. is highly influential,” said Dr. Robert Boyle, a doctor at Imperial College London who has researched international formula use.\n\nIn many places, the lobbying appeared to succeed. Hong Kong, for example, watered down some of its formula regulations after objections from U.S. trade officials, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24486100-uss-adv-letter-to-hkg-ustr-doc-usda-clean-3-29-2016#document/p1/a2441976\">who said in a draft letter</a> that the rules “could result in significant commercial loss for U.S. companies.” And a proposal in Indonesia stalled after questions from the U.S. at the WTO.\n\nNotably, such advocacy has not only hindered local attempts to stop formula marketing that critics say is misleading or even predatory, but it has also undermined the work of <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/resources/fact-sheets/breastfeeding#:~:text=Breastfeeding%20has%20one%20of%20the,well%20as%20greater%20educational%20attainment.\">U.S. foreign aid and health officials</a>, who have long supported breastfeeding across the globe. They call it “one of the highest returns on investment of any development activity” because of its well-documented benefits for babies’ health and cognitive growth.\n\n“I think it is shocking,” said Jane Badham, an independent nutrition consultant and expert in child feeding who works internationally. “One doesn’t realize how much this kind of interference is happening.”\n\nThe meddling broke into public view in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/health/world-health-breastfeeding-ecuador-trump.html\">when officials from the Trump administration</a> were accused of threatening to withhold military aid from Ecuador if the country didn’t drop its proposed resolution in support of breastfeeding at the World Health Organization; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/12/health/breastfeeding-ecuador-todd-chapman.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20did%20not%20issue%20threats,might%20detract%20from%20breast%2Dfeeding\">the U.S. ambassador later denied</a> making threats. But ProPublica’s investigation found that the scope of the interference far exceeded that incident and continues today under the Biden administration. In fact, Ecuador and Thailand were just two stops on a worldwide crusade against regulation that has spanned Republican and Democratic presidential administrations and touched more than a dozen countries, including South Africa, Guatemala and Kenya, as well as Southeast Asian nations such as the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n\nNeither Abbott nor Mead Johnson responded to requests for interviews or to detailed questions from ProPublica. The latter’s parent company, Reckitt, also did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nUSTR officials declined to be interviewed for this story. In response to written questions, an agency spokesperson said in a statement that under President Joe Biden, the trade agency has emphasized respecting the role of foreign governments in deciding the appropriate regulatory approach, including with respect to infant formula. USTR has been committed “to making sure our trade policy works for people — not blindly advancing the will of corporations,” the statement said.\n\nThat has meant moving the office “away from the formerly standard view that too often deemed legitimate regulatory initiatives as trade barriers,” the spokesperson said, adding that the move has “enervated” corporate players who have been used to “getting their way at USTR for decades.”\n\nThe spokesperson, however, declined to provide examples of the new approach in relation to formula. She also declined to respond to questions about government documents that show the trade office under Biden working with other federal agencies to pursue the same playbook on formula as prior administrations.\n\nIn 2021, for example, officials complained to Filipino trade authorities about stricter formula marketing rules they <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24486157-overkill#document/p1/a2441979\">considered “overkill,”</a> and expressed fears about regulatory “spillover” elsewhere in Southeast Asia. In Kenya, they sought to strike a provision in a proposed formula advertising ban after an industry group sent USTR a paper seeking its deletion.\n\nPublic health officials are increasingly raising concerns about toddler milk, especially as companies deploy advertising for products using bold — and, critics say, often unsupported — health claims.\n\nIn October, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a new report warning about the marketing for <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/26436/AAP-clinical-report-Toddler-formulas-offer-no?autologincheck=redirected\">toddler formula</a>. “Products that are advertised as ‘follow-up formulas,’ ‘weaning formulas’ or ‘toddler milks and formulas’ are misleadingly promoted as a necessary part of a healthy child’s diet,” said Dr. George Fuchs III, a lead author of the study. The drinks are worse than infant formula for babies under 1 year, he said, and “offer no benefit over much less expensive cow’s milk in most children older than age 12 months.”\n\nUnlike infant formula, toddler milks are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Nutrition experts have warned about hefty doses of sweeteners and sodium in some brands.\n\nThe Infant Nutrition Council of America, a formula industry group, defended toddler drinks, saying they “can contribute to nutritional intake and potentially fill nutrition gaps for children 12 months and older.”\n\nToddler milk made up just 11% of all formula sales in the United States in 2023, but it was much more popular abroad, according to Euromonitor, which tracks sales data. Worldwide, it made up 37% of sales. In Thailand, it accounted for more than half.\n\nThe country is now struggling to address the consequences of the law’s weakening, researchers and officials say. More than <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/thailand/media/11356/file/Thailand%20MICS%202022%20full%20report%20(English).pdf\">1 in 10 Thai children</a> under 5 years old face what researchers call a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7591309/pdf/MCN-16-e12910.pdf\">“double burden of malnutrition”</a> that leaves some struggling with obesity and others lagging behind growth targets. Increased breastfeeding could help address both problems.\n\n“You go to school and see a lot of kids are overweight,” said Dr. Somsak Lolekha, president of the Royal College of Pediatricians of Thailand and the Pediatric Society of Thailand. “We have a big problem in Thailand.”\n<h3>Targeting “the Sippy Cups of the World”</h3>\nFormula is one of only two products with international recommendations to prohibit its marketing. The other is tobacco.\n\nThe warning dates to 1981, when the nations that make up the governing body of the WHO passed the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes. It aimed to stop all promotion of drinks meant to replace breast milk.\n\nThe move followed <a href=\"https://waronwant.org/sites/default/files/THE%20BABY%20KILLER%201974.pdf\">reports in the 1970s</a> that thousands of infants in impoverished countries were falling ill and dying after drinking formula.\n\nNot only were mothers using costly formula to replace breast milk, which would have given their babies better immunity, but the water parents mixed milk powder with was sometimes contaminated, leading to life-threatening bacterial infections and diarrhea. Overdiluted formula was causing severe malnutrition, too. Activists called for a boycott of the world’s biggest formula maker, Nestlé, which had heavily promoted its products in developing countries.\n\nDuring the height of the controversy, an average 212,000 babies in low- and middle-income countries died preventable deaths linked to formula use annually, <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w24452\">an academic paper circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research</a> estimated last year. (Nestlé disputed the research and said it was the first formula company to incorporate the WHO recommendations into its marketing policy in 1982.)\n\nThe United States cast the sole “no” vote against the international code, with the Reagan administration citing First Amendment protections on advertising. The Washington Post quoted a senior federal official who resigned over the decision, saying it would be “seen in the world as a victory for corporate interests.”\n\nTo be sure, formula was crucial for babies who didn’t have access to breast milk. But for those who did, public health experts feared aggressive advertising and free samples would derail a critical cycle. Once babies start drinking formula regularly, research shows, their <a href=\"https://extension.unr.edu/publication.aspx?PubID=4492#:~:text=Your%20milk%20production%20is%20decreased,as%20well%20as%20your%20baby\">mothers’ breast milk supply can drop</a>.\n\n“The evidence is strong,” <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/media/115916/file/Multi-country%20study%20examining%20the%20impact%20of%20BMS%20marketing%20on%20infant%20feeding%20decisions%20and%20practices,UNICEF,WHO2022.pdf\">a WHO and UNICEF report</a> explains. “Formula milk marketing, not the product itself, disrupts informed decision-making and undermines breastfeeding and child health.”\n\nIn the years since the international code was adopted, <a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/354221/9789240048799-eng.pdf?sequence=1\">at least 144 countries</a> have sought to enshrine its voluntary restrictions into laws that bar formula marketing in stores, hospitals and elsewhere. Despite poor enforcement in many places, the laws have had measurable benefits. Studies have shown that countries that adopted marketing bans <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515674/\">saw their breastfeeding rates rise</a>, and more breastfeeding is in turn linked to <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(21)00090-9/fulltext\">fewer infant deaths</a>. It also reduces mothers’ risk of certain cancers.\n\nBaby formula manufacturers responded to slower growth in infant formula sales by creating products for older babies and toddlers — age groups that fell outside most regulations.\n\n“We have a proven global demand-creation model,” Greg Shewchuk, Mead Johnson’s head of global marketing, told investors in 2013. “Capture baby very early on, often before it’s born, hold onto them through feeding and their feeding challenges and extend them as long as possible.”\n\nMead, which was based in the United States until a British company bought it in 2017, termed the strategy A-R-E: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1452575/000110465913022211/a13-7693_1ex99d1.htm\">Acquisition, Retention, Extension</a>.\n\nTo make toddler products more attractive to parents, who usually just gave their kids cheaper cow’s milk beginning at age 1, formula makers began adding nutritional supplements like DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish and algae with purported benefits for brain and eye health.\n\nThe claims, however, are unproven. Studies have found no definitive link between babies’ brain and eye development and DHA supplementation, a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000376.pub4/full\">meta-analysis of 15 studies</a> found, according to Cochrane, a nonprofit that supports systematic reviews of health research. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/breastfeeding#tab=tab_1\">breastfed babies perform</a> better on intelligence tests.\n\nStill, formula companies used additives like DHA “as a hook to expand their market share,” said Peter Buzy, CFO and treasurer of Martek Biosciences Corp., which produced DHA, at an analysts’ meeting in 2004. “Really targeting, you know, the sippy cups of the world.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Infant Nutrition Council of America defended the health and nutrition claims, saying they “are based on science and medical research and meet all legal, regulatory and nutritional science requirements.”\n\nThe marketing worked. Toddler milk has overtaken infant formula in worldwide sales, according to Euromonitor. Global toddler milk sales have grown by 25% since 2013, to almost $20 billion. A little less than two gallons of toddler milk can cost $30 or more, compared with <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-average-price-data.htm\">around $3.94</a> a gallon for regular milk in the U.S.\n\nFor formula manufacturers, the popularity of the product had another benefit: It helped them circumvent local rules against marketing infant formula. By using similar logos, colors or fonts across product lines, legal advertisements for toddler milk effectively promoted baby formula too, even in places where it was subject to a marketing ban. Nutrition experts and advocates called the tactic “cross-promotion.”\n\nDuring the past decade, sales of regular infant formula grew about 10% worldwide, to $15 billion.\n<h3>A Focus on Developing Nations</h3>\nIn 2014, Jintana gave birth to the couple’s first child, whom they nicknamed “Captain” after a soccer player.\n\nThe family lived in military housing in Lopburi, a rural province two hours north of Bangkok whose capital city is world famous for its flourishing monkey population. With Sumet serving in the Army, Jintana took time off from her job in customer relations to care for the newborn.\n\nShe breastfed Captain until it was time to return to work three months later. The couple shopped for formula. Health claims formula makers listed on packages were “very important,” Sumet said through a translator. They settled on a product called Dumex that promised to strengthen Captain’s brain, immunity and eyes. It was made by the French giant, Danone, which boasts that the brand <a href=\"https://www.danone.com/id-cards/thailand.html\">“has happily raised generations of Thais.”</a>\n\nMillions of women like Jintana had been entering the workforce in developing regions such as Southeast Asia. The big six transnational companies that make most of the world’s baby formula saw this as a boon.\n\nFor Mead Johnson, the maker of Enfamil, the benefits of developing economies were twofold. “Firstly, in most countries, breastfeeding is incompatible with women participating fully in the workforce,” CEO Kasper Jakobsen said in a 2013 earnings call. “And, secondly, as women participate in the workforce, that creates a rapid increase in the number of dual-income families that can afford more expensive, premium nutrition products.”\n\nBy then, Thailand was Mead’s fifth-biggest market worldwide. And <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9991832/\">Southeast Asia was well on its way to becoming more important </a>to the formula industry than the U.S. and European markets combined.\n\nAs business boomed, advocates lambasted the industry for its practices. Mead employees, for example, allegedly <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2015-154\">bribed</a><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2015-154\"> health care workers</a> at government hospitals in China so they would recommend the company’s formula to new mothers — charges the company ultimately resolved with a $12 million settlement in 2015; the company did not admit or deny regulators’ findings in the agreement. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-24530034\">Danone faced similar allegations from Chinese media</a> related to the brand Captain and Gustun drank, Dumex. Danone said at the time that it accepted responsibility for the lapses and suspended the program involved, according to the BBC.\n\nThe industry maintained close relationships with the medical establishment in Thailand, too. One pediatrician and advocate for breastfeeding, Dr. Sutheera Uerpairojkit, told ProPublica that two decades ago, she saw formula companies offer doctors and medical staff trips abroad in exchange for giving patients free samples and collecting their data. Some took the trips. Sutheera did not participate.\n\nThailand adopted the international code in 1984 — but only as a voluntary measure. Over the years, Siriwat and others pushed for tougher formula marketing restrictions without success. In one meeting, he and colleagues at the Thai health ministry pressed formula companies to comply with the voluntary rules, which they’d routinely broken. The businesses resisted. “One company said, ‘If I do not violate, I cannot compete with other companies,’” Siriwat recalled in September.\n\n“That makes me very angry,” he said, remembering how he stormed out of the room.\n\nBy 2014, with Thailand’s <a href=\"https://mics-surveys-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/MICS4/East%20Asia%20and%20the%20Pacific/Thailand/2012-2013/Summary/Thailand%202012%20MICS%20Summary_English.pdf\">breastfeeding rate at only 12%</a>, according to one survey, Siriwat persuaded the health minister to seek legislation to formally ban marketing infant and toddler formula. He wanted the new law to include enforcement and penalties for violators.\n\nThe WHO, a United Nations agency promoting health, wanted more countries to pursue such measures. Its staff in 2016 released new <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_7Add1-en.pdf?ua=1\">recommendations on ending the promotion of formula products</a> for toddlers, as well as infants. In theory, that guidance could help countries like Thailand fend off trade complaints about new marketing bans. And an endorsement by the WHO’s member nations would underscore the recommendations’ importance.\n\nBut public health wasn’t the only concern as nations prepared to vote.\n<h3>U.S. Intervention on a Global Stage</h3>\nThe WHO effort alarmed formula makers, which worried that it would kick off a new round of laws against formula marketing. “That’s what’s at stake by a new measure that’s being proposed by the WHO, without any scientific evidence,” Audrae Erickson, a Mead Johnson lobbyist, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gya0CCZuVYs\">told a trade association crowd</a>.\n\nIndustry groups scrambled to arrange meetings with high-level officials in Washington. “Clearly, the potential economic and international trade implications from this proposed draft guidance are quite significant,” the pro-industry Infant Nutrition Council of America said in a letter to an FDA official in 2016.\n\nThat year, companies and trade groups connected to commercial milk formula, including Abbott Laboratories and Nestlé, spent almost $7 million lobbying U.S. officials about WHO matters, after a decade in which their lobbying disclosures had not mentioned the organization at all, a study found.\n\nThe industry’s outreach spanned Washington. The Infant Nutrition Council of America, for instance, lobbied the Senate, House and USTR — as well as the commerce, state, agriculture and health departments, lobbying records show. The efforts attracted the attention of leaders in both parties, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called President Barack Obama about the issue, according to records obtained by ProPublica.\n\nInside the administration, USTR took up the formula industry’s cause. “USTR does not support issuance of the guidance or resolution” on toddler milk, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24487542-stradtman-comment#document/p1/a2441983\">wrote Jennifer Stradtman, a USTR official</a>, in an email to other federal officials. Furthermore, she wrote, her office “will not be able to accept” any resolution that encouraged WHO member countries to convert any of the guidance into law.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time the USTR sided with industry despite public health concerns: In 2013, a group of Democratic senators scolded <a href=\"https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senators-urge-ustr-to-safeguard-tobacco-control-measures-and-protect-public-health-in-trade-agreement\">U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman</a> for a proposal to help tobacco companies use trade law to “subvert” tobacco control measures — a stance the lawmakers called “deplorable and a serious threat to global public health.”\n\nIn the debate over toddler milk, officials from Froman’s office repeatedly questioned science, prompting a fight with public health officials, internal documents show.\n\nIn one exchange, then-USTR lawyer Sally Laing objected to a sentence from the guidance that said research suggests food preferences are established early in life.\n\n“Unsupported,” Laing wrote.\n\nHealth officials pushed back on that, as well as other USTR edits. “MUST NOT DELETE,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protested in all caps, arguing that key language in the resolution was, in fact, backed by scientific evidence. But such concerns appeared to get lost in the debate, as those sentences were ultimately struck from the text.\n\nMeanwhile, as WHO member nations gathered to vote in Geneva, formula lobbyists had U.S. officials “on speed dial” and urged them to weaken the WHO resolution, said Jimmy Kolker, who led the negotiations for the U.S. as an assistant secretary in the Health and Human Services Department.\n\nAnd the industry’s agents appeared to have inside knowledge. A baby-formula industry association lobbyist cornered Kolker. “From her approach, it was obvious to me that she had been forwarded an internal, very-limited-distribution USG email,” he wrote in an email to other U.S. government officials. “This is unacceptable and makes our job as negotiators significantly more difficult.”\n\nIn the end, the United States delegation persuaded WHO nations not to “endorse” their staffs’ own recommendations. Instead, the body voted only that it “welcomes with appreciation” the guidance — language that undercut its utility. The resolution, lacking the weight of an official endorsement, left many nations puzzled over whether it would help neutralize trade complaints.\n\n“That has caused a lot of confusion,” said Laurence Grummer-Strawn, a WHO official who focuses on child feeding and former nutrition chief for the CDC. “What does that really mean?”\n\nStradtman and Laing could not be reached for comment. Froman did not respond to requests for comment, and a USTR spokesperson declined to comment on the office’s actions during the WHO debate. In a general statement, the spokesperson said that “with regard to infant formula, USTR, in conjunction with others in the interagency, work to uphold and advocate for policy and regulatory decisions that are based on science.”\n\nThe practical impact of the resolution’s weakened wording became clear within months, when the U.S. and other dairy producers like Australia and Canada accused Thailand of attempting to obstruct trade with its marketing ban. Thai officials argued their country had a “strong need for a regulation,” saying the “sales promotion” of milk formula for babies and toddlers contributed to the nation’s low rate of breastfeeding. But when it referenced the WHO’s guidance and resolution to support its position at the WTO, the U.S. countered that those measures did not amount to “an international standard.”\n\nWhen the Thai National Legislative Assembly finally passed its formula marketing measure in April 2017, the provisions that the U.S. and its allies — plus some Thai doctors and industry lobbyists — had complained about most loudly were either watered down or gone entirely. Lawmakers had reduced the maximum criminal penalty for violations from three years in prison to one year in prison and the maximum fine from about $8,730 to $2,910, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24487552-thailands_milk_code_passed_the_national_legislative_assembly_bangkok_thailand_4-20-2017-2-copy#document/p2/a2441985\">a USDA document shows</a>.\n\nThe law banned the marketing of infant formula and outlawed cross-promotion, but it still allowed advertising on products for 1- to 3-year-olds.\n\nAt a June 2017 meeting of the WTO, the U.S. called the changes “a welcome modification.”\n<h3>“Addicted to the Bottle”</h3>\nThe next year, Sumet and Jintana celebrated the birth of their second child, Gustun. As she had with her firstborn, Jintana breastfed Gustun until he was 3 months old, then started him on formula so she could go back to work.\n\nThe couple diligently followed the “stages” prescribed by Dumex, which came in a cheery red package: Stage 1 formula when Gustun was an infant, Stage 2 when he was an older baby and Stage 3 when he became a toddler. He craved formula, and his parents, believing it was healthy, always gave him more. By the time he was 3, he reached his peak weight of about 66 pounds — the same as an average<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/set1clinical/cj41c021.pdf\">9-year-old</a>. He was drinking six or seven bottles a day, each holding about 12 ounces of toddler milk.\n\nJintana wasn’t worried at first as Gustun grew pudgy. His brother, Captain, had been big, too — almost 60 pounds — at the same age. But when Gustun started school in person after the pandemic, his teachers were concerned. They had seen others arrive, as one put it, “addicted to the bottle.” The weight slowed Gustun down during movement time, his teacher Tida Rakrukrob said through a translator. “He would move slowly and was less active compared to other children,” she said.\n\nWhen another teacher posted <a href=\"https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNq9CcJ3/\">a video</a> on TikTok showing herself comforting and talking with Gustun one day, it went viral — receiving 732,000 likes and many comments about how cute he was. But his teacher’s concern with his difficulty moving led his parents to bring him to see a doctor, who tested him for a hormone imbalance and checked him for diabetes. The tests came back negative. The parents reduced the fried food, dessert and snacks Gustun ate.\n\nThe biggest change the family made, though, was eliminating toddler formula from his diet. His school gave him cow’s milk instead, as it did for other children.\n\nGustun’s extra weight began to disappear.\n\nLooking back, Jintana said she thinks he gained so much “because of the toddler milk.”\n\nToday at age 6, Gustun is no longer on a restricted diet — he can eat fried food and dessert — and weighs 35 pounds, about half of what he weighed at the peak of his Dumex consumption. He is more outgoing at school, Jintana said, and plays soccer with his older brother every day. Captain lost a similar amount of weight after switching to cow’s milk at school and is now 9 and slim, weighing around 51 pounds.\n\nOne Monday in September, the brothers — both in soccer jerseys — kicked a ball back and forth in the driveway of the family’s brightly painted red house. Gustun, who has a lightning bolt shaved into his hairline, chased the ball and tried to get it away from his brother, who darted about quickly, tapping it from foot to foot.\n\n“Now, his movement is perfect,” his mother said.\n\nDanone, the company that makes Dumex, said in a statement that while breast milk offers children the best nutritional start, “50 years of scientific research into nutritional needs in early life underpins our products, and we do not make claims that have not been backed up by scientific research.” The company said that research has shown that toddler milk can provide nutrition and help improve the diet of children age 1 and older, reducing the risk of iron and vitamin D deficiency.\n\n“We encourage parents to follow the guidelines on pack when using our products, which are carefully calibrated so that babies and infants receive the right amount of nutrients they need each day from our products,” the company said.\n<h3>“The Tactic is ‘I Will Violate Your Law’”</h3>\nThailand’s marketing restrictions have done little to curb practices like cross-promotion, said Nisachol Cetthakrikul, who has worked in the Thai health ministry and studied the law.\n\nIndeed, at two supermarkets in Bangkok, shiny walls of powdered formula boxes seven shelves high greeted shoppers on a warm day in September. There were few differences between packages for products intended for babies and those intended for toddlers.\n\nFormula makers and stores offered steep discounts for toddler milk, calling one a “Mommy Fair Shock Deal.” An offer on one shelf told parents if they spent about $87 on Hi-Q1 toddler formula, made by Danone, they could receive a free yellow and blue swing set worth about $27. Other offers included a clay “pizza dough cooking fun set,” a toy keyboard and microphone, and even a pushable “speedcar trolley” that a toddler could sit in.\n\nA <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35733357/\">2022 study</a> led by Nisachol found 227 instances of formula marketing that violated the law.\n\nThe government has levied fines for violations, but Thailand’s health ministry doesn’t name offenders. “The tactic is ‘I will violate your law,’” Siriwat said, “‘and prepare the budget for the fine.’”\n\nThai health authorities have tried to fight back by raising parents’ awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding. The health ministry, for example, erected billboards saying “breast milk is medicine” and called doctors to a meeting to urge them to promote breastfeeding among their patients. But these campaigns are no match for the formula companies’ massive spending on marketing, Siriwat said.\n\nWhile Thailand’s exclusive breastfeeding rate for babies six months or younger rebounded to <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/thailand/press-releases/unicef-finds-1-3-mothers-thailand-exclusively-breastfeed-their-babies-far-below\">about 29% in 2022</a>, UNICEF found, it is still far short of the WHO’s target of at least 50% by 2025. The country’s rates of obesity and stunting for children 5 and under are higher today than <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/thailand/sites/unicef.org.thailand/files/2018-06/Thailand_MICS_Full_Report_EN_0.pdf\">they were in 2016</a>, the year before the watered-down formula law passed.\n\nDr. Somsak Lolekha, president of the Thai pediatric society, said formula isn’t the only reason for children’s weight problems. But it plays a big role, he said, because it’s so easy to drink — a point that tracks with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4301835/#CR12\">studies showing that</a> babies who breastfeed longer are less likely to become obese and develop diabetes than those who drink formula.\n\nLast summer, Thailand joined more than 100 nations at the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva to explore ways to fight unethical formula marketing. Attendees sat at long tables in a sleek, modern auditorium. Like other nations’ representatives, Dr. Titiporn Tuangratananon, an official with Thailand’s health ministry, declared her intentions on brightly colored paper posted at the front of the room: “Fully control” the marketing of formula to young children, and “Increase + expand enforcement.”\n\nIn an interview, Titiporn said health officials are trying to update the country’s marketing rules — including making some forms of toddler formula advertising, such as giveaways, discounts and free samples, illegal.\n\nBut that could ultimately prove difficult in a country that is now the seventh-largest market in the world for formula.\n\nIn fact, according to Titiporn, the government has already been deluged by public comments critical of its regulatory efforts. She suspected the pro-marketing remarks, some of which had been repeatedly copied and pasted, came from representatives of the formula industry.\n\n“We know that it’s not real,” Titiporn said. “It’s not the real mothers.”\n\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://pixel.propublica.org/pixel.js\" async></script>\n",

Wilson <strong>resegregated </strong>a federal bureaucracy that however imperfectly, had begun to integrate--even though the city surrounding it was still very segregated.  In 1901--in the very same magazine where Frum makes the case to uncancel him--Woodrow Wilson argued <strong>against </strong>suffrage for black men, prior to his tenure as president of Princeton University.  Frum's recounting of Wilson's anti-black, while rather detailed, still fails to capture its full breadth and depth.  <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53207649#\">Wilson as Princeton University president blocked black students from attending the school</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having already elected Trump once, in spite of (or in too many cases because of) explicitly racist and xenophobic appeals, the United States could very well elect him again despite numerous criminal indictments, a finding of fact that he sexually abused E.

Wilson did nominate Jewish people to serve on the state supreme court as governor of New Jersey, and the Supreme Court as president.  But that does not trump all the ways in which he used the increasing power he was given over the course of his life to make life worse for the black citizens of this country in every way possible.  Frum touches lightly on the ways in which Wilson's scholarship (he was trained as an historian) reflected his personal bigotry.  <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/woodrow-wilson-racial-segregation-jim-crow-ku-klux-klan\">Wilson wrote a five-volume history textbook that adhered to the Lost Cause propaganda regarding the Civil War</a>.  Here is Wilson writing in one of those volumes, A History of the American People: Reunion and Nationalization:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The white men of the South were aroused by the mere instinct of self-preservation to rid themselves, by fair means or foul, of the intolerable burden of governments sustained by the votes of ignorant negroes and conducted in the interest of adventurers: ... There was no place of open action or of constitutional agitation, under the terms of reconstruction, for the men who were the real leaders of the southern communities.  Its restrictions shut white men of the older order out from the suffrage even.  They could act only by private combination, by private means, as a force outside the government, hostile to it, proscribed by it, of whom opposition and bitter resistance was expected, and expected with defiance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=3iz3qF6MQ4kC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cthe+intolerable+burden+of+governments+sustained+by+the+votes+of+ignorant+negroes%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FvUpkcTzzk&amp;sig=ACfU3U3a-P1gHcb-7WsoF3mMsuNqBQtJZA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjjvYft8qnqAhU5lXIEHVEvAv8Q6AEwAnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cthe%20intolerable%20burden%20of%20governments%20sustained%20by%20the%20votes%20of%20ignorant%20negroes%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false\">A History of the American People: Reunion and Nationalization, Woodrow Wilson, pp 58-59</a></cite>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> In this brief passage, we see Wilson's views of black citizens in their full ugliness.  We see his wholehearted adoption of the pro-Confederate views of his parents, particularly <a href=\"https://www.todayingeorgiahistory.org/tih-georgia-day/woodrow-wilson/\">his father (who served as a Confederate chaplain and preached sermons in defense of slavery)</a>.  Wilson fairly explicitly argues in subsequent pages that forming the Ku Klux Klan and engaging in violent anti-black terrorism was the only resort for the white insurrectionists of the American South.  It is therefore no surprise that D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/11/20/9766896/woodrow-wilson-racist\">quoted Wilson's book in its title cards</a>.  To the extent that Woodrow Wilson is judged the preeminent bigot of his day, perhaps it is because he promoted the Lost Cause in his scholarship, in his presidency of Princeton, from the White House, and in popular culture through screening and popularizing a gleefully racist film.   As numerous Republican governors send National Guard contingents in defiance of a Supreme Court ruling acknowledging the primacy of the federal government in policy at the international borders of the United States, and a supposed contestant for the GOP presidential nomination advocates openly for the right of Texas to secede from the country, it is hard not to look at these words from over a century ago and not see ideological support for contemporary lawlessness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wilson's early and ardently anti-black scholarship stands as a rebuke to Frum's feeble excuse of Wilson's 1919 stroke as the reason that black citizens were undefended by federal power during the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theworldwar.org/learn/about-wwi/red-summer\">Red Summer</a> of that same year.  Per Frum's own piece, he threw disillusioned black supporters out of his office in 1914 and never received them again.  He made W.E.B. DuBois regret ever supporting him in a way paralleled decades later by Jackie Robinson's disillusionment with Richard Nixon for the same courting of white grievance Wilson engaged in generations earlier.  Frum attempts to treat the imperialist and xenophobic stances of Henry Cabot Lodge (who attempted to justify and excuse the lynching of 11 Italian immigrants in New Orleans in 1891) as somehow equivalent with Wilson's anti-black bigotry. But if we're comparing flaws, it needs to be said that nearly 3000 black citizens died at the hands of white lynch mobs during Wilson's presidency alone.  Wilson was no less an imperialist than Lodge, for while he granted greater autonomy to the Philippines (which Lodge wanted to annex), he also ordered the invasion and occupation of Haiti.  Wilson's anti-blackness was such that it did not even stop at the borders of the United States.  Whatever his other shortcomings, Lodge at least saw fit to author and sponsor a House bill to protect Black voting rights in the South (a legislative effort which would not be repeated for another 70+ years).  If there is anything Frum's piece makes clear, it is that anti-blackness has <strong>never </strong>been the sole province of either the progressive or conservative movements in this country.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An actual historian would better articulate the negative consequences of Wilson's lifelong failure to acknowledge the humanity of the black citizens of this nation.  They would provide a better tribute to the Harlem Hellfighters, maligned by their white countrymen and commander-in-chief at home, disrespected by most of their military commanders abroad, more honored by the French under whom they actually fought, and feared by the Germans (who trolled them with <a href=\"https://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6655/\">leaflets dropped from planes</a> for their service to a country in which they could only be second-class citizens at best).  The open and unapologetic racism we see both in the political class and in the country at large is in too many ways a throwback to America of Wilson's day.  For Frum to choose this moment to advocate for Wilson to be \"uncancelled\" is to repudiate everything he has ever written and said about the dangers Trump posed--and still poses to the survival of multi-racial, multi-ethnic democracy in this country.  It should be seen as a deliberate insult to every black citizen in the present day.  I wish David Frum the worst in his efforts to rehabilitate Wilson and his racism.  I hope this small piece of writing encourages further scrutiny of Wilson and his contemporaries and brings them greater scorn and contempt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Whether you're an pen-and-paper note taker (my preference), or someone who types notes on a laptop on-the-fly, you'll be far more likely that you'll know not just what you need to do, but how your work connects to the work of others if you capture the right information.  Depending on your role (and I've found this to be more and more true as I've gone further in management), if you distribute your notes you can become the person that doesn't just keep track of agendas, but the person who sets and drives them as well.  Depending only on your memory in a professional context is effectively trying to work with both hands tied behind your back.  And that's before you even get into meeting length, subject, or any other attributes of meetings at work.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taking notes isn't merely about recall, but reuse.

Domestic travel has taken my wife and I to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Scottsdale, New York, and Minneapolis.  While the pandemic isn't really over, I started taking an annual solo trip for brief break from parenting and other family responsibilities.  Philadelphia and Boston were the destinations the past couple of years.  And while a change in my work portfolio toward the end of last year has added a bit of work travel to my schedule, a trip entirely for me will get onto my itinerary for 2024 somehow.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The failure of all of these schemes rested not on a lack of intent, but on not having consolidated federal power in a way Trump and his advisers <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/12/06/1217562544/trump-and-insiders-craft-plans-for-unprecedented-power\">are openly planning to do</a> in a second term should he prevail in November.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Adam Serwer, Who's Afraid of Calling Donald Trump an Insurrectionist?, The Atlantic, January 5, 2024</cite>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In this description, Serwer reminds us that <strong>Pence actually tried to fulfill Donald Trump's wishes</strong>, contrary to the narrative of personal integrity and heroism he crafted for himself.

States in the former Confederacy enacted <a href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/black-codes\">Black Codes</a> to circumvent the 13th Amendment.  The <a href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/black-codes\">14th Amendment was necessary in order to kill the black codes</a> because Andrew Johnson (who became president as a result of Lincoln's assassination) used the office of president to oppose the full citizenship of formerly-enslaved black people.  Reconstruction (which we too often fail to study) was ultimately abandoned by the federal government in the interests of a false and hollow unity.  The Jim Crow laws that arose in the aftermath of Reconstruction's abandonment did so in direct defiance of the Reconstruction Amendments.  For black citizens living in southern states, <strong>the Constitution was meaningless</strong>.  <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/migrations/great-migration\">The Great Migration</a> of this country's black citizens out of the south to points north, midwest, and west was their response to the federal government's abdication of its responsibility to provide them equal protection under the law.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Professional opinion-havers calling on the Supreme Court to overturn what Colorado and Maine have done have decided that the full citizenship of black people in this country should again be subject to the popular will.

The 10 pillars of the index provide some clues as to why the U.S. might rank where it does when you think of local and national policy decisions.  The Health pillar reminds me of the debates around the Affordable Care Act, successful attempts to undermine it in key respects, and continuing efforts to repeal it entirely through the federal judiciary.    Due only in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/13/life-expectancy-men-women/\">life expectancy in the U.S. has been trending downward</a>.  The U.S. also has maternal mortality rates far higher than most peer countries in the OECD (and non-OECD countries like Romania and Croatia).  Maternal mortality rates seem primed to worsen due to the impacts of the Dobb's decision on access to abortion, since states where abortion access is most restricted already have worse rates of maternal mortality than states where the procedure isn't banned.  Infant mortality rates are also higher than that of most of our peer countries in the OECD as well. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The  Efficient and Inclusive Institutions pillar includes the courts and public services (the robustness of which vary widely depending on which state in the country you're talking about).  When it comes to the education and learning pillars, the mobility framework focuses much more on very early childhood education, vocational training, and other primary and secondary education factors. When I think of education, I think of how much more constrained it has become at the post-secondary level over the past 20 years due to significant increases in tuition.  During the same time multiple states (including my home state of Maryland) drastically reduced the level of subsidies that had made in-state tuition a bargain and a no-brainer for students who were bright and ambitious but lacked the funds for truly elite education.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Technology Access as a pillar of social mobility is near and dear to my heart, given my career and past experiences from childhood and adulthood with dial-up internet at home.  I seriously doubt I could have built the middle-class lifestyle I enjoy (and that I have provided to my wife and children over the past dozen years) without the education access, quality, equity (and affordability) and technology access I've been given going back decades.  Access to high speed internet (at home, school, and/or public libraries), affordability of home and/or school access, accessibility in rural areas, monopolies on broadband provision, and electricity availability in rural areas have probably combined to make this access very unevenly distributed across the country.  The shorthand for this in numerous news articles and other reports is \"the digital divide\".  There appears to be a growing body of scholarship around <a href=\"https://largescaleassessmentsineducation.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40536-022-00143-7\">inequality in remote learning quality during COVID-19</a> subsequent to this social mobility report that should shed more light regarding the impacts of insufficient technology access internationally. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Pillars 6-8 cover work opportunities, fair wages, and working conditions.  The Working Conditions pillar in particular uses the following benchmarks \"the level of workers' rights, collective bargaining coverage, meritocracy at work, labour-employer, cooperation, as well as the percentage of workers working longer than 48 hours per week\" (page 17 of the full report).  Here in the U.S. we have right-to-work states, a very low federal minimum wage, and unions which had been steadily eroded in strength up until very recently.  All those factors before even talking about the ways in which certain employers have used <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/05/04/1173697113/immigrant-child-labor-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">illegal/undocumented workers--including migrant children</a>, and the downward pressure undocumented labor puts on wages.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last but not least, the pillars touching on the relative strength social safety net in each country measured.  Compared to other wealthy nations, our social safety net is weak.  How we handle unemployment (and unemployment benefits), job transitions, etc are just a few areas of consideration.  One area where this is the most obvious might be maternity leave and paternity leave.  An ex-pat friend of mine who lives and works in Berlin described a much more generous and family-centric system when it came to the experience of his wife having their son there than my own experience with my wife having twins here in the U.S. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Do So Many Immigrants Still Come Here?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is one question usually posed in response to the sort of data and statistics I've shared earlier.  But the same data statistics also answer this question.  If you look toward the bottom of the global social mobility index rankings, here are some of the countries we find there:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Honduras (73rd out of 82)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Guatemala (75th out of 82)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>India (76th out of 82)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Senegal (80th out of 82)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Cameroon (81st out of 82)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Côte d'Ivoire (82nd out of 82)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Further from the bottom but still in the second half of the index are countries like China (45th), Vietnam (50th), Thailand (55th), Mexico (58th), Brazil (60th), Philippines (61st), El Salvador (68th), and Ghana (70th).  Even at 27th, the United States still offers far more social mobility to ambitious immigrants from these countries.  The United States is also the third-largest country by population on Earth, behind only China and India.  The ethnic diversity of the United States might also be attractive to immigrants because it increases their likelihood of finding community in an otherwise-new place.  While it was a much earlier era for my parents and their family and friends coming here from the Caribbean in the 1960s, they built new community here and had more educational and economic opportunities here than they had at home in places like Jamaica, Guyana, and Trinidad.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether the United States remains the destination of choice for most immigrants is an open question.  Much depends on the results of the 2024 presidential election.  Even if the nominees are as expected (Trump for the GOP and Biden for the Democrats) and Biden manages to win re-election, Biden has retained certain Trump-era policies around immigration in his first term.  A second Trump term would certainly bring an even harsher version of the immigration regime initial championed by Jeff Sessions as attorney general and by Stephen Miller, and include attacks on birthright citizenship despite it being part of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What's the Bottom Line on the American Dream?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is no shortage of anecdotes from people coming to the U.S. and achieving great success.  My parents and many of their friends achieved much greater success for themselves and their children here than they would have had in their own country.  That success was by no means easy.  Both of my parents earned all of their degrees (undergraduate and masters') in night school.  My sister and I were latchkey kids as a result.  Success anecdotes aren't the only data points though.  The results of emigrating from one's country of origin do not fall neatly into a binary of \"success\" or \"failure\".  For every story like that of my parents, there are probably others of people who have achieved less than my parents and would still count coming to America as a success.  There may be others who achieved more than my parents but would still judge their emigration experience a failure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The immigrant experience of America is definitely not the only one that matters when it comes to how people regard the American Dream, and whether it can realistically achieved.  People born and raised here, with parents, grandparents, and other prior generations born here have had a different experience and a different set of expectations.  Some people have cynically used (and continue to use) the success of my parents and their generation (and their children) as a way to blame black people with many generations of American heritage for their relative lack of achievement.  The white grievance politics ascendant on the political right these days has found a ready audience among those who resent that the days of households where dad worked, mom stayed home with the children, and a high school education was enough for steady employment, a middle-class lifestyle, and being able to send those children to college are long gone.  It is easier to blame immigrants, \"wokeness\", and foreign aid for that changing than it is to acknowledge the reality that by both inertia and conscious policy choices, government and corporations both undermined each of the ten pillars the social mobility index framework is built upon.  That's why the American Dream--while still achievable--is harder.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I hope using AI to augment human capabilities (like the Iron Man suit) is the destination we get back to, after the current pursuit of replacing humans entirely (like Ultron) fails.

I've been seeing their posts on Twitter for years, but didn't dive deeper until I heard <a href=\"https://hanselminutes.com/922/education-should-be-free-with-freecodecamps-quincy-larson\">Larson interviewed recently on Hanselminutes</a>.  The 30-minute interview was enough to convince me to <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate\">add Larson's organization</a> to the short list of non-profits I support on a monthly basis.  One of the distinctions I appreciated most in the interview was the one made between <em>gate-keeping</em> and <em>rigor</em>.  Especially in the context of certifications (in an industry with an ever-growing number of them), making certifications <strong>valuable</strong> is a challenge that FreeCodeCamp solves by making them challenging to get.  Having pursued a number of certifications over the course of my tech career (earning a Certified Scrum Master cert a couple of times, the AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate, and an internal certification at work for <a href=\"https://help.securecodewarrior.com/hc/en-us\">secure coding</a>), I've seen some differences in how the organizations behind each certification attempt to strike that balance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>\n<strong>Certified Scrum Master</strong>.  Relative to cloud certifications for AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, CSM certification is much easier.  Two days in an instructor-led training course, followed by a certification exam and you have a certification that's good for 2 years.  I don't recall what my employers paid for the courses to get me certified each time, but these days you can spend anywhere from $500-$1100 per person for the 2-3 day class and exam.  I think the minimum score to pass is 80%, and one of my classmates the last time I certified got 100% (I missed out on that by a single question).  In short, less rigorous (and far less gate-keeping).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>\n<strong>Certified AWS Solution Architect Associate</strong>.  I spent months preparing for to take this certification exam.  Just the associate-level exam itself costs $150.  The <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03/\">self-study course</a> and <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/\">practice exams</a> I took (both from Udemy) normally cost $210 combined, though there are plenty of other options both online and instructor-led (I expect the latter would cost significantly more per student than instructor-led training for other certifications.  Achieving the minimum score to pass (usually around 70%) is far from certain, given the sheer amount of material to retain and the high level of rigor of the questions.  I ended up scoring around 80% but I really had to sweat for it.  Much more rigorous, but rather low on gate-keeping as well because of the relatively low cost of self-study and practice exams (and the ability to do hands-on practice with the AWS Free Tier with a personal AWS account).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The key value of rigor is that the process of preparing to take a certification exam should meaningfully apply to actually doing the work the certification is intended to represent.  My experience of pursuing AWS certification is that the learning did (and does) apply to design discussions.  It's given me valuable depth of understanding necessary to push my teams to fully explore different services for building features.  One of my direct reports used the knowledge gained from certification to build equivalent functionality out of AWS services approved for use inside our organization to approximate the functionality of an AWS service currently not approved for use (in order to integrate with a third-party vendor we were working with).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I talk to people in different fields where certifications are available, I get the distinct sense that there are varying degrees of gate-keeping involved (a practice that tech companies are certainly no strangers to).  My wife has said this often regarding HR certifications offered by SHRM.  She's been an HR director for over 20 years (without that certification) but hasn't been able to pass the certification exam (despite having a master's degree in HR management).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When considering whether or not to pursue a certification, it's definitely a good idea to look at them from the additional perspective of whether they are gate-keeping--or providing rigor--not just if they will help you advance your career.  If you can, find out from people who've actually earned the certification whether they feel like it helped make them better at their job.  Some certifications are must-haves regardless of their rigor or utility, either because your employer requires them or because eligibility to pursue certain contracts requires them (particularly in the federal contracting space).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

A friend in one of my Slack groups shared this <a href=\"https://kottke.org/23/10/the-50-greatest-music-videos-of-all-time-ranked\">Jason Kottke post</a>.  The second video on the page (Peter Gabriel's Sledgehammer) was my first introduction to him.  The song came out in 1986, the video won 9 MTV Video Music Awards the following year.  The company who did the animation for the video, Aardman Animations, would later go on to create Wallace and Gromit (an inventor and his pet dog) who've starred in a number of short films (The Wrong Trousers) and feature-length films (The Curse of the Were-Rabbit) that I found hilarious.  Chicken Run was an Aardman co-production with Dreamworks that I also enjoyed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While researching this post, I learned that another one of my stop-motion favorites--The Nightmare Before Christmas--actually came out the same year as The Wrong Trousers (1993).  Nightmare was very much in keeping with the dark and scary sensibilities of Tim Burton (the man behind Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, among many other films), but to make it a musical as well was just hilarious and delightful.  Isle of Dogs and Fantastic Mr. Fox are two more stop-motion animated features I've enjoyed.  One of my guiltier pleasures when it comes to stop-motion animation was definitely Celebrity Deathmatch.  Stop-motion animated wrestling matches between clay versions of celebrities was way more fun than it had any right to be.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While not actually stop-motion animation, The Lego Movie (and its sequel) succeed at hewing very closely to the same style, with the obvious exceptions of the live action scenes.

I'm only two episodes in (episode 5 released on November 15) and I am completely absorbed.  The title of the podcast isn't clickbait--it's literally the truth.

The episodes I've listened to so far went into some depth regarding Eric Bishop's predecessor as prime minister, Sir Eric Gairy.  His iron-fisted rule of Grenada, which stretched back before it achieved independence from Great Britain, was enforced by the Mongoose Gang.  The descriptions of this group of thugs with police powers reminded me of the <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/latin-america-and-caribbean/haiti-history/tonton-macoutes\">Tonton Macoutes</a> of Haiti under Jean-Claude Duvalier.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Listening to episode 2 in particular, it was sad to see how quickly Bishop adopted the rhetoric of Gairy, even if he didn't go as far as forming a secret police.  Bishop's rule in Grenada ultimately ends in gunfire either as a result of unwillingness to share power, not being extreme enough in his embrace of Cuba and the Soviet Union, rivalry and jealous within the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-Jewel-Movement\">New Jewel Movement</a>, or some combination of all of the above.  I'm very much looking forward to the rest of the series and what else I can learn from it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

To me, Mitt's father George looks much better than his son by comparison because at every possible point, Mitt looked at the choices his father made (and the negative political consequences of those choices) <strong>and decided not to follow his father's example.</strong>  George Romney turned around a struggling automaker in Detroit in the 1950s.  George Romney supported the civil rights movement, even trying and failing to prevent the GOP from surrendering to the likes of Barry Goldwater and his ultimately successful efforts to push black voters out of the GOP.  George Romney served the Nixon administration as HUD secretary, trying to increase the supply of housing available to the poor and to desegregate the suburbs, but was deliberately undermined by Nixon in many cases.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>His son Mitt by contrast <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html\">wrote a New York Time op-ed titled Let Detroit Go Bankrupt</a> in 2008.

Romney said that they account for '47 percent' of voters and he does not 'worry about those people.'\"</a>  Also during that campaign, Romney actively solicited the endorsement of Donald Trump--who was still actively fueling the birther conspiracy about Barack Obama at the time.  Coppins cites numerous earlier examples of choices he consciously made in the interest of political expediency.

Coppins expresses the belief (and Sykes seems to agree) that the turn of the GOP was a sudden one when in fact it was not.  Here's what Sykes says per the transcript:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You know, it occurs to me that his nomination in 2012 in many ways was a false indicator because, the party had already begun to change dramatically, but we were able to tell ourselves as conservatives that the center would hold that this was still the party that would nominate George Bush and John McCain and Mitt Romney.  So it's not the party of Pat Buchanan.  It's not the party of Don[ald] Trump.  I mean, they're there, but there's a reason why, you know, people like Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich don't ultimately win.  Yes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Charlie Sykes, The Bulwark Podcast, November 2, 2023</cite>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sykes is at minimum 4 years too late in identifying the \"false indicator\" election for the GOP nomination.  The John McCain who won the GOP nomination in 2008 was a far cry from the man who ran in 2000.  The John McCain of 2000 <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96031231\">who specifically (and correctly) named Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as agents of intolerance on the political right </a>was replaced in 8 years by a version who made peace with them, and cemented their support by choosing Sarah Palin as his vice president.  What I was not aware of at the time, was that Palin was known commodity among the ardently pro-life in the GOP.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries#March_contests\">Mitt Romney placed a distant third in pledged delegates in the 2008 GOP primary</a>, behind Mike Huckabee.  In 2012, Romney would follow McCain's playbook in staking out hard right positions (for political expediency) to beat his contenders for the GOP presidential nomination only to be defeated when voters didn't buy his attempts to move back to the center for the general election.  As Romney (and others in the GOP) would demonstrate again and again in subsequent years (through the Trump presidency to the present day), having power was more important than having integrity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, even one of those in the GOP who briefly showed sufficient spine to vote in favor of impeaching Trump for his role in the January 6th insurrection has begun to develop his muscle memory for surrender.  Peter Meijer, one of 10 House Republicans who did so (and was ultimately defeated for re-election as a result), has pledged to support the Republican nominee for president in his current run for the Senate--going even further to say that Joe Biden had done more to disgrace the office of the presidency <strong>than the man he voted to impeach just a couple of years ago.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meijer is no worse than the current pretenders for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024.  Nearly all remaining contenders pledged to support Trump even if he is convicted on one (or many) of the 91 different felonies he has been charged with.  One angry social media outburst from Trump and the House speaker candidacy of Tom Emmer (notable for his relative lack of surrender to Trumpist priorities) went down in flames.  His replacement--Mike Johnson--is unknown and inexperienced as a legislator, but was one of the key advocates of the Big Lie regarding the 2020 election and still to this day refuses to acknowledge that Joe Biden won the election.  Even as Trump-backed candidates and priorities continue to cost them victory after victory in ballot initiatives (like the one in Ohio that put the right to abortion into the state constitution) and in elections (like the ones in Virginia that saw Democrats retake full control of the General Assembly and the Kentucky gubernatorial election that kept the Democrat Andy Beshear in power and rejected the Republican state attorney general Daniel Cameron), the GOP's muscle memory for surrender to its most extreme elements is too strong for them to break.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

In the clips of Ronald Reagan speeches played during the episode, it was interesting to hear anti-communist rhetoric as the rationale for invading Grenada just a few years before the scandal we call Iran-Contra would be brought into the light.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/the-grenada-intervention-the-united-nations-caricom-and-jamaicas-foreign-policy-in-the-1980s/\">Other Caribbean nations (Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, and Jamaica actually played a role in the invasion</a> as well.  Jamaica sent 150 troops via an Air Jamaica 727 who served in a peacekeeping role well after U.S. troops arrived.  All six nations also voted against the U.N. resolution condemning the invasion.  A <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/10/25/US-Caribbean-forces-invade-Grenada/1142726918271/\">UPI piece</a> I found lists Barbados and Antigua as also providing soldiers for the invasion while St. Lucia, Dominica, and St. Vincent sent police officers.  The same UPI piece does a good job of putting the U.S. invasion of Grenada in historical context, noting that Haiti and the Dominican Republic were invaded and occupied for multiple years on 3 separate occasions during the 20th century. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The same organization whose <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/research-centers/center-on-extremism\">Center on Extremism</a> claims to \"strategically monitor, expose and disrupt extremist threats\" removed the notorious Libs of TikTok account (and Chaya Raichik, the woman behind it) from their extremism list after she threatened a lawsuit.  <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/04/tech/adl-makes-peace-with-x/index.html\">This isn't even the first retreat of October 2023 for the ADL, having resumed advertising on Twitter after Elon Musk threatened to sue them for defamation the month before</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To oppose the open-ended <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230330214438/https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2021/Costs%20of%20War_2001%20AUMF.pdf\">Authorization for Use of Military Force that would enable military operations in no less than 22 countries</a> (including the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, and war in Iraq, and detention of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba) was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/08/17/barbara-lee-afghanistan-vote/\">a lonely endeavor that came with death threats, insults, and hate mail</a>.  While there is almost certainly more (and growing) opposition to the IDF bombing campaign in Gaza than there was to the US invading Iraq, any sympathy at all for unarmed Palestinian civilians unaffiliated with Hamas (or any other militant group) has come with consequences like firing from jobs, revocation of job offers, threats of deportation from Donald Trump, and a Senate resolution condemning specific campus chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine (per <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/adl-palestine-terrorism-letter/\">Ackerman's reporting</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our country treated the 9/11 attacks as an existential threat--a thing that could cause the U.S. to cease to exist.

Anti-semitism--whether here in the U.S. or abroad--is never far beneath the surface.  Not much time has passed since <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/\">the former president defended neo-Nazis and others protesting the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue as \"very fine people\"</a>, or since the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh killed 11 and wounded 6 worshippers--including Holocaust survivors.  As with the U.S. and the countries we attacked with military force in response to 9/11 however, the difference in military power between Israel and those who threaten it is substantial. Depending on which reports you read, between 5000 and 10,000 Palestinians have died in airstrikes from Israel's military--the vast majority of those women and children.  This death toll--the vast majority of them civilians--will only grow.  The civilian death toll during the so-called Global War on Terror is orders of magnitude larger.  Prior to the latest attacks by Hamas, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-detention-jails-palestinians-west-bank-793a3b2a1ce8439d08756da8c63e5435\">Israel was holding over 1200 people in detention (virtually all Palestinians) without charges or trial</a>.  Per AP's reporting, Israel's military justice system is what Palestinians are subject to, not unlike the military tribunals used at the Guantanamo Bay prison to try terrorism suspects.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unlike the U.S. military, Israel can't leave where it is.  It can change its policies and its leaders, but not its neighbors.  I have no idea what the answer is to whether or not Israel and the Palestinians will ever be able to co-exist in a status other than \"cold\" war or hot war.  But the ways Israel's response to October 7 rhymes with the US response to September 11 probably mean we'll be asking that question for a long time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

It’s a non-fiction graphic novel covering the journalist’s 2 months in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from December 1991-January 1992.

Including a podcast aimed at Christians (like myself) may seem puzzling at first.  But it's necessary because trying to understand the region includes being aware of how American Christianity's understanding (some might more bluntly say misunderstanding) of our own faith distorts our perspectives and our policy in that region.  <a href=\"https://theworld.org/stories/2016-10-24/why-american-evangelicals-are-huge-base-support-israel\">American evangelicals have been, and continue to be huge supporters of the state of Israel</a>.  This is where one of the distortions comes in: John Hagee's group (Christians United for Israel) lobbies senators and congressmen regarding our country's policies toward Israel. One of the key reasons for that support is a self-interested one however--<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israel-uproot-ancient-christian-mosaic-armageddon-sparks-outcry-102275464#:~:text=Some%20view%20the%20founding%20of,support%20for%20the%20state%20nonetheless.\">a belief that a state of Israel is necessary for the second coming of Jesus Christ and that Jews will either convert to Christianity or die</a>.  John Hagee is just one of a number of evangelical preachers that have <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-john-mccain-should-reject-the-reverend-john-hagee/\">disturbing views</a> about the reasons for the Holocaust as well as what will happen to Jews in the future as he interprets the Bible.

She is a self-described \"white Ashkenazi Jew\" but pulls no punches in calling her co-religionists to task for their bloodlust and desire for revenge.  In addition to calling out the immorality of bloodlust, she discusses some of the non-violent resistance to occupation Palestinians have engaged in (and the response of US states to it) as well as the deaths of Palestinians at the hands of Israeli settlers.  If you aren't already on Bluesky, it might be worth it to join if only to read this.

I'm not here to set Dave Filoni's entire filmography on fire.  Contrary to some, I think The Clone Wars and Star Wars: Rebels were better than the prequel movies.  Ahsoka is a key character in both The Clone Wars and Star Wars: Rebels, which is why so much of the fandom (myself included) was excited to see her in live action in The Mandalorian.  Grand Admiral Thrawn wasn't just a key antagonist in the last couple of seasons of Star Wars: Rebels, he's one of the best villains in Star Wars--and notably one who George Lucas did not create.  Timothy Zahn is the author behind Thrawn (and each of the 13 novels that feature him), including <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Heir_to_the_Empire\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Heir_to_the_Empire\">a trilogy</a> set after the events of Return of the Jedi that would have made for a much better sequel trilogy than the one which ultimately made it to theaters.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In retrospect, <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/ahsoka-star-wars-rebels-season-5-dave-filoni/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://ew.com/tv/ahsoka-star-wars-rebels-season-5-dave-filoni/\">this interview</a> where Dave Filoni essentially agrees with the perspective that Ahsoka could be seen as season 5 of Rebels was a warning.  This confirmed that viewers would basically have had to do the homework of watching most everything with Ahsoka in it to grasp everything going on in the show.  Enough time has passed since I watched Rebels in full that there were multiple points in the show where I didn't get what was going on.  And that's before you get to the now infamous \"space cartwheel\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<div class=\"tenor-gif-embed\" data-postid=\"3794813662628081605\" data-share-method=\"host\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.76596\" data-width=\"100%\">\n<a href=\"https://tenor.com/view/ahsoka-space-fight-star-wars-rosario-dawson-ahsoka-tano-gif-3794813662628081605\">Ahsoka Space Fight GIF</a>from <a href=\"https://tenor.com/search/ahsoka-gifs\">Ahsoka GIFs</a>\n</div>\n<p> <script type=\"text/javascript\" async src=\"https://tenor.com/embed.js\"></script></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even viewers who did the homework must contend with the addition of a master-padawan relationship between Ahsoka Tano and Sabine Wren that wasn't in any of the shows.  This was far from the only opportunity missed to use flashbacks to add missing context and flesh out characters so they actually mattered to the audience (whether they'd \"done the homework\" or not).  I've said on social media that Dave Filoni did better character development with The Bad Batch than he did in Ahsoka.  The same is true of Jon Favreau and The Mandalorian.  With this show, Filoni leaned far too hard on <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bacowett.bsky.social/post/3kb6y5sj34j23\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bacowett.bsky.social/post/3kb6y5sj34j23\">\"unearned, MCU-level 'remember this?' tropes that rely more on good memories than actual character development.\"</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beyond the \"homework\" problem and lack of character development in the show itself, Ahsoka was stuffed with too many competing storylines to do any of them justice.  For me, there wasn't enough in the show to explain the loyalty of the Night Sisters of Dathomir to Thrawn's cause, or Hera Syndulla's fear of his return.  As I write this, I have yet to see any confirmation of Ahsoka being renewed for another season.  Assuming it doesn't get cancelled, I'm pessimistic that a second season would improve on the shortcomings of the first.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a world where you can get free email accounts seemingly anywhere, I recently decided to pay for an email service.  This doesn't mean that I don't still have Gmail, Microsoft/Hotmail, iCloud, and Yahoo accounts--but it's another step back toward paying for products and service instead of <strong>being </strong>the product.  I chose <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.com/pricing/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.fastmail.com/pricing/\">Fastmail</a> on the recommendation of a friend who has used them for many years.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fastmail's value proposition and advertising revolves primarily around security, privacy, no ads, no tracking--all of which are good.  But the features I've found the most valuable so far are actually their search and mail rules.  I have a fairly common first and last name.  And unfortunately for me, this has meant receiving <strong>a lot</strong> of email in my Gmail account over the years that is intended for someone else.  The email contents range from the merely annoying (emails from various GOP candidates for political office) to documents with PII and other content that is supposed to be confidential.  But Fastmail's mail rules setup allows me to delete that stuff from my inbox without ever having to see it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another feature Fastmail offers is Masked Email.  You can use it to create a unique email address everywhere you log in on the web, and block addresses if you start receiving spam from them.  What I do instead is use two domains that I own to create unique email addresses on-the-fly.   What the setup with Fastmail lets me do is make up an email address on the spot with one of those domains and know that I'll receive any email sent to it.  For example: I go to Walgreens the other day, and made up an email to give to the person at the register for the myWalgreens program so I can get the associated benefits without giving them my real email.  The mail rules let me filter these emails (and others like it) out of my inbox.           </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The email that's actually intended for me I can label, filter, and receive notifications for if they're really important.  Fastmail also lets you create a rule based on a  single message to control how future messages are handled (a capability that can also be applied to blocking senders).  Whether I'm using the web application on my MacBook Pro, on the mobile apps on my iPhone or iPad mini, I get the same experience of email actually being useful again--including not missing important ones.  It might be nice to have an actual desktop client, so I may try the <a href=\"https://terrygodier.com/reviews/fmail/#:~:text=FMail%20is%20a%20free%20Mac,Full%20Fastmail%20settings\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://terrygodier.com/reviews/fmail/#:~:text=FMail%20is%20a%20free%20Mac,Full%20Fastmail%20settings\">FMail client</a> someone developed and see if I like that better.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fastmail makes it easy to onboard with a 30-day free trial where you can use it as the interface to whatever free email account you currently use the most.  For me, that's still Gmail.  The import process (which had years of emails to pull over) worked perfectly.  Because Fastmail can receive and send Gmail, I've had no need to use the Gmail web client or its mobile apps directly for weeks.  I've even deleted Gmail from my phone and tablet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I still have plenty of work ahead when it comes to unsubscribing my Gmail email address from <strong>so many things</strong>!  Email lists, newsletters, stores, and all manner of other online services in the nearly 20 years since I first signed up for it.  But as I do (and re-subscribe to just the things that matter most), Fastmail is helping make email a useful tool again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

This preserved the functionality while making all of the javascript visible.  The bookmarklet itself works nicely, opening a pop-up that autofills the New Bookmark page with the URL, title, and description fields.  When adding a bookmark, I forgot that multi-word tags weren't allowed and got an error message like the one below:<br><br>invalid tags: #invalid tag must be in #hashtag #format, tag name supports a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and the following word separators: -_.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you get that error, the bookmark isn't created.

Years after it happened, I recalled that Trump's initial Muslim ban <a href=\"https://www.genxjamerican.com/2020/11/08/empathy-now/\" title=\"\">kept the spouse of one of my co-workers at the time from joining him</a>. A second co-worker at the same job was married to a man from Somalia, one of the seven countries subject to that ban.

It might not even be fair to Substack Notes to call it a social media option.

No one conflates American identity with the descendants of slaves.  Our Americanness is as a degradation of our being.  So we exist as like a not real people.  There is a way in which black failure is American, but black self-determination would be communist.  Part of an American identity is to treat black people like garbage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Gray: So the condition of our American status is to be a second-tier, third-tier, fourth-tier member of the society.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Osei-Frimpong: And a condition of their American status is to think of us as second-tier, third-tier, fourth-tier.  I think part of the middle class identity is to flee black people.  Lineage is the American identity.  People have to think about Jim Crow as a forward-facing regime.  They were saying that not only are you not anything, but your grandkids won't be anything.  The regime as always not just about you, but of your line.  Your great-grandparents weren't anything, and your grandkids won't be anything.  The regime is realized when you look at the outcomes today.  The problem is we think of the Jim Crow regime and race in general as like a static moment ... when it was always a statement about a line in the past and a line in the future.  And I think that line has held.  Anywhere there's a congregation of black people--80% or above--it's not someplace that you necessarily want to drink the water.  And that is not an accident.  People think that Jim Crow just affected lineage property holders--which is true.  But it's not just in property holding.  [Jim Crow] overdetermined all of our institutional relationships, including the church, education, and family.  I think the black family was overdetermined by the needs of surviving Jim Crow.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>a recent Bad Faith Podcast with guest Irami Osei-Frimpong</cite>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Osei-Frimpong's argument regarding the status of black people in America isn't entirely new (as captured in <a href=\"https://www.genxjamerican.com/2023/03/26/reading-the-south-through-the-lens-of-caste/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">book-length treatments of the subject I've read this year</a>), but neither Wilkerson nor Reed make the case as bluntly that this lower status is a condition of being seen as being American and belonging in America.  Through the lens of Osei-Frimpong's argument, the ongoing discourse around Florida's recent changes in what is taught about slavery can be seen as a variation on this idea of belonging.  Defenders of these changes (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/22/desantis-slavery-curriculum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">including Florida governor and 2024 presidential candidate Ron DeSantis</a>) insist on the idea that black people benefited from enslavement because of the skills they gained--as if black people had no skills other than those taught by their enslavers.  These are not the arguments of those who actually see black people as equals.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some defenders of these new standards, such as <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/kamala-harris-is-brazenly-lying-about-floridas-slavery-curriculum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">Charles C.W. Cooke of National Review</a>, have gone so far as to call Vice President Kamala Harris a liar in print for characterizing the changes this way.  But the list of items he compiles, rather than refuting Vice President Harris' point, actually does more to confirm it.  Some examples:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Instruction includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit</strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes how slavery was utilized in Asian, European and African cultures</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes the similarities and differences between serfdom and slavery</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes the comparative treatment of indentured servants of European and African extraction</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Exams the condition of slavery as it existed in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe prior to 1619</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes how trading in slaves developed in African lands (e.g., Benin, Dahomey)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes the practice of the Barbary Pirates in kidnapping Europeans and selling them into slavery in Muslim countries (i.e., Muslim slave markets in North Africa, West Africa, Swahili Coast, Horn of Africa, Arabian Peninsula, Indian Ocean slave trade)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes how slavery was utilized in Asian cultures (e.g., Sumerian law code, Indian caste system)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes the similarities between serfdom and slavery and emergence of the term \"slave\" in the experience of Slavs</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These and other examples make it clear that the aim of this new curriculum is less to educate children regarding the nature of slavery as practiced in American colonies and what would later become the United States, than to draw false equivalences between it and how slavery was practiced in other cultural contexts.  Not once in Cooke's analysis or his numerous bullet points does term \"chattel slavery\" appear, which would make clear that enslavement was not merely permanent for those originally enslaved, but generational--passed down to any and all descendants.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Others of Cooke's bullet points seem selected to convey the message that other enslavers were worse than colonial (and later American) ones, such as these:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes the harsh conditions in the Caribbean plantations (i.e., poor nutrition, rigorous labor, disease).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes how slavery was sustained in the Caribbean, Dutch Guiana and Brazil despite overwhelming death rates.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Still other select bullet points seek to valorize those in power and the prevailing system of governance as actually working to end slavery, such as these:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes examples of how the members of the Continental Congress made attempts to end or limit slavery (e.g., the first draft of the Declaration of Independence that blamed King George III for sustaining the slave trade in the colonies, the calls of the Continental Congress for the end of involvement in the international slave trade, the Constitutional provision allowing for congressional action in 1808)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instructions includes how different states passed laws that gradually led to the abolition of slavery in northern states (e.g., gradual abolition laws: RI Statutes 1728, 1765 &amp; 1775, PA 1779, ma &amp; NH 1780s, CT &amp; NJ 1784, NY 1799; states abolishing slavery: VT 1777).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Analyze the contributions of founding principles of liberty, justice and equality in the quest to end slavery</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes the contributions of key figures in the quest to end slavery as the nation was founded (e.g., Elizabeth \"Mum Bett\" Freeman, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Instruction includes how Abraham Lincoln's views on abolition evolved over time.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The word \"ordinance\" appears a handful of times, but never in connection with the ordinances of secession, the resolutions drafted and ratified by each of the 13 Confederate states regarding why they were leaving the Union (at least 3 of which mention slave-holding in the context of property rights as their rationale).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of my personal frustrations with this curriculum controversy being focused on slavery is or isn't taught is the ways in which it has diverted attention from the virtual absence of any instruction at all, proper or otherwise, about Reconstruction and Jim Crow--a period of history spanning nearly an additional century after the end of the Civil War of what Osei-Frimpong described as \"a degradation of our being\".  Cooke's analysis mentions Reconstruction just 3 times.  Here is one of those three mentions:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instruction includes how whites who supported Reconstruction polices for freed blacks after the Civil War (white southerns being called scalawags and white northerners being called carpetbaggers) were targeted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite><a href=\"https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20653/urlt/6-4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">Florida's State Academic Standards -- Social Studies, 2023</a>, page 16</cite>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cooke's callout on how Reconstruction impacted certain white people (rather than the black people it was intended to protect) reveals as much or more about his priorities than it does about the curriculum in question.  References to the word \"compromise\" in the standards do not appear to include the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/compromise-of-1877\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">compromise of 1877</a> (of which Florida was one of 3 key states), which ended the Reconstruction era and helped usher in Jim Crow.  Entirely absent from his analysis is any mention of the Great Migration, which was at least in part motivated by the abandonment of Reconstruction by the federal government (which rates a scant 6 mentions in an academic standards document 216 pages long).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jim Crow is mentioned just once in Cooke's analysis, and only five times total in my own search of Florida's new academic standards.  This takes me to Osei-Frimpong's second point regarding Americanness and blackness, that Jim Crow is incorrectly seen as a static period in time.  His characterization of Jim Crow as a statement about the past and future lineage of black people being \"nothing\" crystallized for me in a way few previous commentaries have that the intent of Jim Crow's architects was to ensure a permanent black underclass in the same way their predecessors intended chattel slavery to be permanent.  When Osei-Frimpong says \"there is a way in which black failure is American\", to me it is a reminder of the ways the Lost Cause narrative of the Civil War, and Jim Crow, deliberately omit from the record all the ways in which black achievements were consistently hidden, threatened, stolen, and/or destroyed. As a result, well-meaning bureaucrats like Daniel Patrick Moynihan would write <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/the-moynihan-report-an-annotated-edition/404632/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">The Negro Family: The Case for National Action</a>, which would be used by some to reinforce their previously-held stereotypes of black people with no acknowledgement of how the necessities of surviving Jim Crow might have meaningfully and durably damaged black families.  I'm reminded also of the ways in which prominent conservative black public intellectuals (Thomas Sowell in particular) both in the past and in the present have used the economic success of black immigrants like my own parents as a rhetorical cudgel to beat native-born black Americans for their relative lack of success with no acknowledgement of the differences in the circumstances between us or the impact of the multi-generational denial of the benefits of first-class citizenship on black citizens.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Defenders of these new standards include two members of the working group who created them.

Legacy students are presumed to belong at elite institutions, even though in many (if not most) cases their academic marks would disqualify them for admission absent their legacy status.  The presumption of --if not entitlement to--belonging in elite higher education is apparently acceptable for everyone except (most) black people.

I've switched servers (to hachyderm.io from mastodon.cloud), updated this blog's sharing settings in Jetpack Social to post to Mastodon automatically (replacing the deliberately-broken Twitter integration), subscribed to the <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">Ivory for Mastodon mobile app</a>, made 1813 posts and gained 338 followers.  I only follow 196 accounts, but between that and folks in the Local feed on hachyderm.io I find it to be an informative, enlightening, and fun social media experience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A little over a month ago, I joined Bluesky thanks to a friend's invite.  The protocol it runs on (the <a href=\"https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/10-18-2022-the-at-protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">AT Protocol</a>) is federated, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">ActivityPub</a>.  But as of now, bsky.social is the only place you can sign up (and signups are currently still invite-only).  Nor does it appear that you'll be able to host your own AT Protocol server anytime soon.  Bluesky does implement a few interesting ideas that other social networks should borrow (or steal): (1) app-specific passwords, (2) feeds, (3) domains as handles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I first learned about app-specific passwords in a Mastodon post (which I have not been able to find again because that whole hashtag search thing) announcing the Ice Cubes for Mastodon app had added support for a bridge instance (<a href=\"https://skybridge.fly.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">skybridge.fly.dev</a>) that would let you connect to and use your Bluesky account and your Mastodon account(s) in the same app.  The sign in page recommends using an app-specific password instead of the real one and the link text takes you directly to the UI in the Bluesky app to create one.  In my limited use of the Ice Cubes account for this purpose, the disclaimer about the bridge not working for every Mastodon client proved true often enough to be annoying.  The sign in page recommended the Ivory app as providing the best experience—we’ll explore whether that advice proves true in a future post. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Feeds are the way Bluesky packages algorithms that show certain posts and topics.  Beyond the Following feed (the default feed for every Bluesky user), I’ve added feeds including Mutuals (posts from people you follow who follow you back), Likes (every Bluesky post you’ve liked), and Cat Pics (the content of which should be obvious, but occasionally includes pictures of raccoons and opossums).  Bluesky has made a feed generator starter kit available on GitHub.com, but I haven’t gotten that code working yet.  If I do, and happen to feel particularly ambitious the next step would be to publish and host a custom feed for other Bluesky users to subscribe to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Domains as handles lets you use a custom domain as your handle (instead of a subdomain of bsky.social).  Since I own genxjamerican.com, I took the opportunity to update my handle using the <a href=\"https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">instructions in Bluesky's April 28 blog post</a>.  The process was quick, and the handle change was reflected almost immediately in my Bluesky mobile app (I had to refresh) and immediately in my Ivory app (no manual refresh required).  If Mastodon were able to adopt this feature, it might at least make server switches much easier for people with custom domains. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Without much time on Bluesky, I haven't done much posting, gained many followers, or followed many accounts yet.  Some of the people I follow on Twitter for news (like Phil Lewis) and commentary (like Adam Serwer) are on Bluesky as well (along with fun accounts like Bodega Cats).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Threads is the newest kid on the social media block (launched July 5th) and already has over 100 million users, courtesy of its ability to leverage the large installed base of Instagram users as a starting point.  Unlike Bluesky, Threads plans to join the fediverse so its Threads users can follow and interact with people on other fediverse platforms.  But before Threads was even officially named and launched, numerous instance admins joined an <a href=\"https://fedipact.online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">anti-Meta fedi pact</a>.  The instance admins in the pact agree to block any fediverse instances owned by Meta.  As for the app itself, there are the sort of privacy controls and account settings that will make Threads safe for users (and especially for brands, compared to the anti-woke haven Twitter seems intent on becoming)--but not much else.  You can invite your friends to Threads via WhatsApp, text messages, email, or just about any other method you can think of.  As of yet there are no custom feeds, or lists, or any other features that might let you filter what posts you see.  Since Meta is really about selling ads, I presume its only a matter of time before we start seeing (and scrolling past them) in Threads.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Between the three social media apps I've been spending more time with since last year, Mastodon is still the one I most enjoy using.  I'm still on Twitter, but less often than last year--primarily to engage with a DM group I joined made up of black professionals and academics.  When Twitter first looked like it was on shaky ground, some of us exchanged emails to keep in touch, others shared their Instagram accounts.  If and when Bluesky shifts from invite-only to broader adoption, it looks like the social media option with the most tools to recreate the sort of community we found on Twitter beginning in the pandemic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Such cases used to be about believers being able to observe their religious practice as they chose without being prevented from doing so by the government, or by secular employers, with accommodations being made where possible.  At the very start of my career in IT, my employer tried to compel me to work on Saturdays (my day of worship as a practicing Seventh-day Adventist), and I ultimately quit that company rather than yield to the pressure (or pursue a court case).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now religious freedom in the United States has been distorted to any and every expression of Christian faith in any context, aided and abetted by the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, as an exemption to the laws everyone else in this country must adhere to.  The latest example of this is the case <em>303 Creative v Elenis</em>, recently decided 6-3 in favor of 303 Creative.  Despite the proprietor of 303 Creative <strong>never actually being contracted by a gay couple to create a wedding website, </strong>and despite <strong>not even having expanded her business to offer wedding website services</strong>,   <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/30/303-creative-elenis-supreme-court-decision-lgbtq-rights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">\"she brought a pre-enforcement challenge to the Colorado law, worried, as Gorsuch wrote, “the State will force her to convey messages inconsistent with her belief that marriage should be reserved to unions between one man and one woman,” according to the Washington Post</a>.  So the very prospect of a same-sex couple asking a public business to accept their money in exchange for a service was so alarming that the plaintiff chose to file lawsuits to prevent it.  And after numerous losses in lower courts finally received a ruling in her favor from our nation's highest court.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This idea that engaging in a business transaction constitutes an endorsement of a practice someone deems sinful seems to me either a well-intentioned but significant misunderstanding and misreading of scripture, or a deliberate distortion intended to justify ones pre-existing prejudices.

If any evidence exists that selling tents was somehow an endorsement of whatever lifestyle Jews or Greeks or anyone else in Corinth was engaged in, I have not read it in Acts 18 or anywhere else in Acts.  So how exactly does a Christian in the United States come to the conclusion that making a website for money (or a cake) if the customers are a same-sex couple is an endorsement of same-sex marriage?

Missouri asks the question of Christian evangelicals in general, it should be asked specifically of white evangelicals.  What gospel ethic is communicated by prevailing upon a secular court to sanction your desire to reject the provision of a service to people who haven’t asked you to provide it?  A similar question could be asked of the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop.  Contrast their example with that of the Apostle Paul, and how he engaged with both Jews and Greeks—both in his trade as a tent maker, and in his ministry work.  Christianity spread throughout the Asia of Paul’s day, while many of the membership rolls in Christian churches in the U.S. are shrinking.  Numerous Christian denominations (including my own) are still fighting over whether or not women should hold pastoral roles despite claiming to believe in a Bible with numerous examples of women in leadership in both the Old and New Testaments.  The same Aquila and Priscilla of Acts 18:1-4 can be found later (in Acts 18:26) explaining the way of God <strong>more accurately</strong> to the evangelist Apollos.  Rev. Missouri's question bears repeating in this context: what gospel ethic--what value is communicated in denying particular titles to women in the service of God?  Is the gospel well-served by putting incompetent and/or untutored men in the office of pastor over women to whom God grants the same spiritual gifts as men?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A friend of mine shared <a href=\"https://www.graphsaboutreligion.com/p/religion-has-become-a-luxury-good\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">this interesting Substack</a> post with me which asserts that religion has become a luxury good.

On March 27, 1866, President Andrew Johnson gave <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/march-27-1866-veto-message-civil-rights-legislation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">an entire speech</a> regarding why he was vetoing civil rights legislation passed by both houses of Congress.  Among his many objections were that black people would receive “Federal citizenship” immediately while 11 states were not represented in Congress. The 11 states (of course) were the ones that started (and lost) the Civil War.  Having “just emerged from slavery into freedom”, President Johnson questioned whether or not black people “possess the requisite qualifications to entitle them to all the privileges and immunities of citizens”.  But here is the passage that perhaps best explains and exemplifies the sense of entitlement—both then and now—that some have when compared to the black people who built and fought for this country:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The bill in effect proposes a discrimination against large numbers of intelligent, worthy, and patriotic foreigners, and in favor of the Negro, to whom, after long years of bondage, the avenues to freedom and intelligence have just now been suddenly opened.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>Paragraph 4 of the transcript of President Andrew Johnson’s March 27, 1866 speech vetoing civil rights legislation</cite>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If there is any meaningful difference between the logic President Johnson applied to reject civil rights legislation and the logic the conservative majority on the Supreme Court used to end affirmative action, it is not readily apparent. Within President Johnson’s objections to the granting of “Federal citizenship” to black people and the states right argument he advances to separate “State citizenship” from it are the seeds of modern arguments against birthright citizenship that we hear today from the same people who find common cause with the Confederates of that day.  Should this country put the wrong person in the White House yet again, perhaps birthright citizenship will be among the many rights at risk.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

This piece is primarily about what is likely to happen in the aftermath of the ruling.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The end of affirmative action will require every public and private university in the United States to eliminate race as a factor in their admissions decisions (if they haven't already done so).  In Texas, for example, that means <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2023/06/29/supreme-court-affirmative-action-ruling-texas/#:~:text=Lawmakers%20created%20what%27s%20known%20as,high%20schools%20across%20the%20state.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">UT-Austin will no longer be able to factor race into such decisions, and neither will private universities like Rice and SMU</a>.  However, as Michael Harriot succinctly put it, the end of affirmative action does not mean the end of admission preferences for those whose beneficiaries are primarily white (and/or) wealthy.   At elite schools that use legacy admissions, those students will still be accepted at rates from 11% to 30% (far higher than non-legacies).

The percentage of the undergraduate student body that is black at those same schools: MIT (7%), Princeton (9%), Harvard (15.2%), Carnegie-Mellon University (3%).

Barack and Michelle Obama are the most elite couple ever to grace the halls of the White House regardless of race. Christians who actually went to church for non-political reasons. And for the entirety of their 8 years [in the White House] the political right in this country talked about them like dogs. And that's before you get to the wealthy mediocrity this country elected as a backlash to his presidency. The idea that affirmative action--a policy to which this country's commitment was uneven at best--should have a time limit of mere decades as a corrective to centuries of chattel slavery and Jim Crow (while legacy admissions continue ad infinitum to perpetuate advantage for wealthy and/or well-connected and mostly white mediocrities who would otherwise be shut out of elite education) has nothing to do with \"meritocracy\" and everything to do with anti-blackness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>One of my own angry DMs</cite>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Contrary to the naive notions of those who have consistently opposed affirmative action—including and especially opposition from certain black conservatives—the end of affirmative action in higher education will not end questions about whether a black person in any elite context has earned their place.  Opposition to affirmative action is a very specific, very pernicious form of anti-blackness which rests on two (false) propositions: (1) the number of black people at elite institutions is “unnaturally high”, and (2) native-born black Americans in particular are somehow deficient, even relative to black immigrants.  Too many in this country are vested in the notion that no elite institution can be truly meritocratic if too many black people are a part of it.  So despite the fact that many in elite spheres are there because of the connections and/or wealth of their parents (rather than their own intellectual or artistic prowess), their presence in the elite is never challenged.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The end of affirmative action will not increase the percentage of Asian-American students accepted to elite universities much--if at all.  People of Asian descent are a little over 7% of the U.S. population but are already the largest minority population at elite institutions beyond the half-dozen already named earlier, at three to six times higher a percentage on these campuses than in the general population (over 40% at CalTech for example).  Regardless of how badly people want to believe that admission to elite institutions of higher education will somehow be \"fairer\" in the absence of affirmative action, the reality of college admissions is a far more opaque process.  Each incoming class is curated, and the criteria (and how much weight each input to the admissions process is given) are controlled by the institutions--not the applicants.  Low admission rates and the relatively small sizes of each class are part of the institutional strategy for maintaining their elite reputations.  Legacy admissions almost certainly contribute to the maintenance and growth of the sizable endowments these institutions have.  In the years to come, we will see just how few native-born black Americans actually benefited from affirmative action intended for them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Social media is filled with assertions that elite universities will be able to use socioeconomic status as a proxy for race and still achieve their diversity goals.

The end of affirmative action will therefore mean far fewer black students (and brown students) at elite higher education institutions.  The notable exception to this (which highlights the way in which the Roberts court lacks the courage of its convictions) is military service academies.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"[twitter.com/mcbc/stat...](https://twitter.com/mcbc/status/1674432448892133376?s=61)\&t=0X9xP3RDF7HBiXc9UdtMfg\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"twitter\",\"responsive\":true} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n[twitter.com/mcbc/stat...](https://twitter.com/mcbc/status/1674432448892133376?s=61)&amp;t=0X9xP3RDF7HBiXc9UdtMfg\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Justice Sotomayor calls out Chief Justice Roberts' hypocrisy in allowing military service academies to continue using affirmative action but not religious institutions</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was cowardly enough for Chief Justice Roberts to put the exception in a footnote.

Within hours of his death on the floor of the F train, the media made sure we knew about Neely's mental illness, his long arrest record, previous violent assaults, even one of his public anti-LGBT outbursts.  This latest impromptu obituary of a black man after a violent death had the same effect of those written before--to tell the public that the dead man deserved his fate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The priest and the Levite in the parable are understood to be fellow Israelites--who nevertheless left their countryman in the road to die.  The Samaritan by contrast, despite being someone for whom Israelites had such contempt they would not travel through Samaria or associate with them in any way, had mercy on the man.  So if there is any parallel to be drawn between the parable of the Good Samaritan, and what happened on the train it is this: we are the priest and the Levite.  By \"we\" I don't just mean the people on the train, I mean all of us.  A journalist named <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/07/opinions/jordan-neely-death-homeless-new-york-bailey/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">Issac Bailey has written this sentiment far more eloquently than I have</a>, despite having treated a homeless man in New York City with far more humanity far more recently than I have in the place I call home.  My days as a soup kitchen volunteer, feeding the poor and the homeless in the greater Washington area are years behind me. Far more recently I've stared past them, pretended they weren't there, anything and everything other than actually trying to help them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beyond the immediate moment, we haven't pushed back against the active and ongoing dehumanization and criminalization of the poor and mentally-ill.  Both the rhetoric and the legislation of those we put and keep in power are an unfortunate reflection of our national contempt for those Jesus called \"the least of these brothers and sisters of mine\" in yet another parable, that of <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A31-46&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">the sheep and the goats</a>.

And for this--not even a wound to another passenger--Penny attacked Neely from behind and strangled him to death while other passengers watched and two reportedly helped Penny hold Neely down, ultimately leaving him to die on the train floor in his own waste as he'd involuntarily soiled himself as he died.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I write this on May 8, social media continues to be filled with ex post facto rationalizations of Neely's murder.

So is <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/kinney-county-border-militia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">the militia movement that has taken it upon itself to \"police\" the southern border</a>, and those who volunteer to \"protect businesses from rioters\".  More and more often, these vigilantes are aided and abetted by officials elected to maintain law-and-order and/or paid and trained to do so (such as the police).  NYPD tacitly endorsed Daniel Penny's vigilantism by not taking him into custody.  Governor Hochul's comments effectively blamed Neely for his own death. Hochul does not share a political party with Greg Abbott, but her comments about Neely are no less dehumanizing than <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/01/greg-abbott-illegal-immigrants-shooting-victims-texas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">his regarding the victims of a recent mass shooting</a>.  He called them \"illegal immigrants\", completely ignoring the fact that they were victims of murder in the state he is governor of.  The proliferation of so-called \"stand your ground\" laws not only remove any requirement for those who own guns to demonstrate competence in their use, they eliminate prosecution and penalties for incompetent use--even if it results in the death of innocents. Despite the strong correlation between weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun violence and gun death, states controlled by the GOP continue to weaken the laws further.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite the high-minded talk of those who claim to value life, all the available evidence points to life being even cheaper than ever.  The backlash against the \"racial reckoning\" that some thought would happen in the wake of George Floyd's murder at the hands of the police has proven so strong that we've retreated to the point where a black man like Thomas Chatterton Williams is <strong>loudly</strong> advocating in favor of a vigilantism that has often claimed black men as victims not just in this country's long-ago history but in its recent past and present.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Obasanjo's takeaway from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/04/17/community-is-the-future-of-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">the CEO's letter</a> is that this decade-plus old collection of questions and answers about software development challenges will be used as input for an AI that can replace software engineers altogether.  My main takeaway from the same letter is that at some point this summer (possibly later) Stack Overflow and Stack Overflow for Teams (their corporate product) will get some sort of conversational AI capability added, perhaps even without the <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/04/17/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-artificial-intelligence-bard-hallucinations-unsolved/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">\"hallucination problems\"</a> that have made the news recently.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Part of the reason I'm more inclined to believe that [chatbot] + [10+ years of programming Q &amp; A site data] = [better programming Q &amp; A resource] or [better starter app scaffolder] instead of [replacement for junior engineers] is knowing just how long we've been trying to replace people with expertise in software development with tools that will enable people without expertise to create software.  While enough engineers have copied and pasted code from Stack Overflow into their own projects that it led to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">an April Fool's gag product</a> (which later became a real product), I believe we're probably still quite some distance away from text prompts generating working Java APIs.  I've lost track of how many companies have come and gone who put products into the market promising to let businesses replace software developers with tools that let you draw what you want and generate working software, or drag and drop boxes and arrows you can connect together that will yield working software, or some other variation on this theme of [idea] + [magic tool] = [working software product] with no testing, validation, or software developers in between.

In the case of Stack Overflow in particular, having asked and answered dozens of questions that will presumably be part of the training data set for their chatbot, the quality of both questions and answers varies widely.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I recently finished reading Adolph L. Reed, Jr’s memoir of life in the Jim Crow South and afterwards.  Having read Isabel Wilkerson’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Origins-Discontents-Isabel-Wilkerson/dp/0593230256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">Caste</a> just before (and The Warmth of Other Suns years earlier), I went into Reed’s slim volume looking for points of agreement and points of conflict  between it and Wilkerson’s previous works.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I hadn’t read any of Reed’s book-length work prior to <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/697241/the-south-by-adolph-reed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">The South: Jim Crow and Its Afterlives</a>, but from a few of his articles I understand him to be a left-wing critic of anti-racism and identity politics.  The memoir focuses far more on the way Jim Crow functioned in practice than on criticism of anti-racism and identity politics in the present.  Like Wilkerson’s previous works, Reed’s memoir highlights the arbitrary nature of the penalties to blacks people for challenging the social and legal structures of Jim Crow.  The capriciousness of enforcement is heightened by Reed’s stories of travel from points north to places where Jim Crow governed expectations of behavior even after it was officially repudiated.  As depicted by Reed, the level of effort black people had to go through to comply with the strictures of Jim Crow was substantial, and a thing he only realized in retrospect. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Reed doesn’t soft pedal the apartheid system Jim Crow was in the least, nor the nature of the chattel slavery system that preceded it. He quotes at length from the infamous Cornerstone Speech, references other ordinances of secession from southern states,  and makes clear that the South shot first with the aim of preserving slavery.  White supremacy clearly undergirds both slavery and Jim Crow in Reed’s telling.  But ultimately, Reed’s memoir reinforces his “class-first” worldview and that of others on the left (including his preferred presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Reed’s account of life under Jim Crow and afterwards is very enlightening.  His lived experiences across decades and regions of the United States are both broad and deep, including New York City, DC, and parts of Louisiana (including New Orleans), Arkansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Georgia.  That said, I think there are limits to the power of the Jim Crow experience to explain the present.  Reed's book was published just last year, in the wake of a Trump presidency (a direct repudiation of the nation's only black president) Trump's role in encouraging an insurrection to remain in power, and the continuing engagement in overt appeals to white nationalism by numerous GOP pols and those in their orbit.

A scroll backward through previous posts revealed the problem quickly enough, but life is busy so it took awhile until I had enough time fix it.  The steps I expected I would need to take to resolve the missing images issue were roughly the following:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Start up the old EC2 instance</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Download the old images</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Upload the old images to the new instance on Lightsail</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because I only stopped the previous EC2 instance instead of terminating it, I was able to re-start it.  To download the old images, I'd have to find them first.  Having self-hosted WordPress for awhile, I knew the images would be in subfolders under wp-content/uploads, so the only real question remaining was where exactly the old Bitnami image rooted the install.  Once I <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">\"sshed\"</a> into the instance, that location turned out to be <strong>~/stack/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-content/uploads</strong>.  Images were further organized by year and month of blog posts.

As it turned out, the path was slightly different in the Lightsail image: <strong>~/stack/wordpress/wp-content/uploads</strong>.  Once I uploaded the files with scp, I had to figure out how to move them into the years and months structure that would match my existing blog posts.  Using the in-brower terminal, I was reminded that the tar command wouldn't let me expand the files into an existing folder structure, so I created an <strong>uploads-old</strong> folder and expanded them there.  Then I had to figure out how to recursively copy the files there into <strong>uploads.</strong>  It took a few tries but the command that ultimately got me the result I wanted was this:<br><br>sudo cp -R ./uploads-old/&lt;year&gt;/* ./&lt;year&gt;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, every post with images has them back again. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Nearly three years later, I haven't seen any evidence of disciplinary action against the cops who did all this shooting.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rushdie's definition of democracy was an especially interesting one to me. My parents' native Jamaica has a long history of political violence where the party you supported could have the most serious consequences for your physical well-being. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has written about mob violence and vigilantism occurring w/ the knowledge and consent of political parties not just in India, but elsewhere in southern Asia (<a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/09/03/political-violence-in-south-asia-triumph-of-state-pub-82641\">https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/09/03/political-violence-in-south-asia-triumph-of-state-pub-82641</a>).

Putin comparing himself to Peter the Great as he rationalizes his continuing invasion of Ukraine is a present example.  The MAGA movement led by Donald Trump (though leadership of that movement is being quite vigorously contested now) is certainly another.  The conservative Christian groups <a href=\"https://www.genxjamerican.com/2022/01/08/1-6-and-9-11/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">I've written about previously</a> are certainly harkening back to a pre-Civil Rights Movement point in American history as the place to which they want the entire country to return.  In retrospect, even some of the rulings of the conservative majority on the Supreme Court are explained by this framing.  As <a href=\"https://www.genxjamerican.com/2022/07/02/an-ironic-independence-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">I wrote last year</a> after the leak of Alito's draft opinion which would ultimately overturn Roe vs Wade, black men and women had no rights the government was bound to respect and (white) women were scarcely better off than that.  I'm old enough now to remember a culture warrior from decades earlier, Pat Buchanan, harkening back to what (in my memory at least) was probably the Revolutionary War with his \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fzCJRT8Xxo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">ride to the sound of the guns</a>\" catchphrase.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beyond Rushdie's clear-eyed views of India, England, and the United States, his life speaks volumes regarding how petty and small what we call \"cancel culture\" today really is.  The list of detractors regarding his novel The Satanic Verses is quite long, and included Prince (now King) Charles, John le Carré, Roald Dahl, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the British Foreign Secretary, and Jimmy Carter, among others.  Cat Stevens (now Yusuf Islam) agreed with the fatwa calling for Rushdie to be murdered. Remnick's piece includes the following shameful remark from the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would not shed a tear if some British Muslims, deploring his manners, should waylay him in a dark street and seek to improve them.  If that should cause him thereafter to control his pen, society would benefit, and literature would not suffer.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>The Defiance of Salman Rushdie, by David Remnick, The New Yorker, February 13 &amp; 20, 2023 Issue</cite>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Trevor-Roper's remark can only be seen as more gruesome in the light of attempted and successful murders of translators of the book into Italian and Japanese, the attempted murder of the book's Norwegian publisher, and the firebombing of bookstores that carried it.  In light of the rough reception his book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid would receive less than two decades later, I wonder if former president Carter ever revisited and revised his opinion of Rushdie's book.  Rushdie proves far more gracious to at least one of his critics than they were to him:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2099,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://genxjamerican.micro.blog/uploads/2025/85a63453f5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2099\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile, the New York Times published a defense of J.K. Rowling--using Rushdie as an example of what could happen to her if she continued to be criticized--just a day after hundreds of current and former New York Times contributors published <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/02/new-york-times-trans-coverage-response\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">an open letter critical of the paper's coverage of trans people</a>.  Rowling, like Rushdie, was a signatory of the <a href=\"https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">Letter on Justice and Open Debate</a> published in Harper's Magazine a couple of years ago.  The ways in which the two signatories choose to use their free speech (one to attack trans people, the other to write novels) couldn't be more different, but the New York Times (predictably, in my view) treats them as the same.  I still believe, <a href=\"https://www.genxjamerican.com/2020/07/10/thoughts-on-cancel-culture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">as I wrote then</a>, that the signatories of the Harper's letter were asking that \"controversial\" speech be somehow more privileged than other speech.  But Rushdie has paid a far higher price for his art--from other artists and his own government (beyond the one that actually issued the fatwa)--than Rowling has paid (or will ever pay) for using her substantial platform to punch down at a community that has been, and continues to be under siege. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The collusion of the press with business to invent this concept of \"quiet quitting\" still makes me angry.  Having <strong>seen and been subject to layoffs [myself]</strong>, stingy benefits, and being underpaid relative to my experience and skillset for a good chunk of my career, it's laughable to me that these companies expect loyalty for how little they offer in return.

Over the 4 years I was there, they shed well over half their workforce (even as they acquired failing competitors).  The friends of mine at those companies that lost jobs never seemed to lose them because of performance.  The RIFs I would be on the wrong side of in later years never seemed to be either.

The original rationale for hosting on EC2 was to have a project and a reason to do things in AWS other than whatever a certification course might teach.

The real work was getting that new instance to look like the old one.  Getting my posts moved over wasn't hard, since I make a regular habit of using Tools &gt; Export &gt; All Content from the dashboard to ensure I have a WordPress-compatible copy of my posts available.  The theme I use however (Tropicana) recommends far more plugins than I remember when I first chose it.  The Site Health widget nags you about using a persistent object cache, so I tried getting the W3 Total Cache plugin working.  I kept seeing an error about FTP permissions that I couldn't resolve so I got rid of the plugin and Site Health said the server response time was ok without it.  Another plugin I got rid of was AMP.  Something about how I had AMP configured was  seemed to prevent the header image from loading properly.  With AMP gone, everything worked as before.  Akismet Anti-Spam and JetPack are probably the most important plugins of any WordPress install so I made sure to get those configured and running as soon as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The last change I needed to make was the SSL certificate.  The Lightsail blueprint for WordPress (the official image from Bitnami and Automattic) has a script which automatically generates certs using Let's Encrypt.

Once I figure out the photo gallery plugin, that should be the next update.  I'll also be looking into the ActivityPub and WebFinger plugins as part of my growing interest in Mastodon. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

In the wake of last year's takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk, I've been pointing people to Hanselman's decade+ old advice because I'm seeing it repeated in various forms by others (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">Monique Judge of The Verge</a> is the most recent example I've read).  In the time since that November 2019 post, I've published at least 60 posts (with a couple dozen more still in drafts).  But the best-written and fiercest piece I've read on the subject is <a href=\"https://catvalente.substack.com/p/stop-talking-to-each-other-and-start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">this Substack post by Catherynne M. Valente</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Her piece is well worth reading in full and sharing with friends.  I'm just 5 years older than Valente, and reading it gave me a flashback to the very first page I ever put on the web.  It was probably back in 1994, since the Mosaic browser had just come out the year before.  I was a sophomore computer science major at University of Maryland then, so it would have been wherever they let students host their own pages. It was just some fan page for the team they used to call the Washington Redskins.  I somehow figured out how to take an image of the team’s helmet and make it look debossed under everything else I put on the page.  It was the first time I got compliments from strangers for something I did on the internet (in a Usenet newsgroup for fans of the team).  Usenet is how I joined my first fantasy football league.  Many of the guys I met online in that league back in 1993 are still friends of mine today.  I later met a number of them in-person when I visited the Pacific Northwest for the first time (and I've been back a couple more times since).  Usenet is how dozens of us Redskins fans ultimately met in-person and attended a Redskins game together in San Diego (LaDainian Tomlinson's rookie debut in 2001, and Jeff George's debut as Redskins starting QB).  So much life has happened since then that until I read a post like Valente's, it’s very easy to forget all the different ways in which much less sophisticated tech than we have today proved to be very, very good at helping us make meaningful, durable connections with each other.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The 12-point plan of how online communities are created and ultimately destroyed is the heart of her piece.   A lot of the friends I first made on on Usenet, or even email distros have migrated through a lot of the same sites Valente listed as having fallen victim to that plan.  The migrations to Mastodon (or Instagram, or Slack, or Discord, or Reddit, or SMS groupchats, etc) sparked by Twitter turning into $8chan (as some only half-joking call it now) is a reminder of many previous site &amp; app migrations.  Personally, I'm splitting the difference--spending a bit more time on Slack with friends, an ongoing chat with my cousins via <a href=\"https://groupme.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GroupMe</a>, and more time on Mastodon in favor of a bit less time on Twitter (less doomscrolling at least).  Particularly in the depths of the pandemic (which sadly still seems far from over), some of my Twitter mutuals found and formed a real community in a direct message group.  There are nearly 20 of us, all black, in business, tech, academia, science, and journalism among other fields.  They've been some of the most encouraging people regarding my writing beyond my own family.  One of them gave me the opportunity to be a panelist on a discussion of diversity in tech.  I continue to learn from them through our ongoing conversations and value our connections enough to have shared other contact info with them if Twitter does go down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some of us have already learned that <a href=\"https://www.genxjamerican.com/2022/11/10/your-mastodon-experience-may-vary-and-not-always-in-a-good-way/\" title=\"\">the grass isn't always greener elsewhere</a> when it comes to social media.  What's being done to Twitter by Elon Musk right now--as much value as I still personally gain from using it--has been an opportunity to reconsider how I engage with social media.  I've been much more selective about who I follow on Mastodon (just 85 people vs over 800 on Twitter) and am seeing a lot more technical content as a result.  This change in my social media experience is intriguing enough that by this time next year I may be one of those people who went from having just a basic grasp of how Mastodon worked to self-hosting an instance and writing all about the experience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Some were middle-class couples in the cactus-lined gated communities that dot suburbs like Mesa and Glendale.

The category also includes alcohol and drug use, which numerous studies have found are more policed but no more common among Black or low-income people than other groups.</p>\n<p>Roughly 20% of Black people in Maricopa County are living below the poverty line, compared to about 13% of all county residents, though having money should not be thought of as a requirement for good parenting, family advocates said.</p>\n<p>In an interview, the director of DCS, Mike Faust, said the data used for this article is based on a stretch of time, 2015 through 2019, that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->began with a caseload crisis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the department. Over that period, he said, the agency made sweeping changes, including improving its intake and risk assessment tools in order to reduce subjective decision-making and unnecessary investigations.</p>\n<p>“We’ve gone from what I think most people would describe as the worst-performing child protection agency in the country to one that — I don’t know if you’ll ever have a high-performer child protection agency, given the nature of the work we do — but it’s drastically different,” said Faust, who is white and has led the agency since 2019.</p>\n<p>Yet the most recent available federal data through September 2020 shows that while it is true that DCS has reduced the overall number of families it looks into statewide, the decline did not improve — and in fact worsened — the racial disparity.</p>\n<p>Although 7,400 fewer white children were the subject of investigations completed from the 2016 to 2020 fiscal years, the number of Black kids whose parents were investigated dropped by less than 100. (Some children did not have a race identified.)</p>\n<p>“It didn’t have an immediate impact on just African American children,” Faust acknowledged. “The commitment that I make is to continue to stay engaged as an organization. And trust me, these are some challenging conversations to be in. It’s been difficult. But you’ve got to keep coming back to the table regardless of, at times, that people share that raw emotion.”</p>\n<p>Faust, a conservative Republican with a private-sector background, may be out of a job by next spring. The election last month of Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, as Arizona governor likely means that DCS will have a new leader and possibly a new approach to racial disproportionality in the coming years.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Joe Wolf, a spokesperson for Hobbs’ transition, pointed out that her career has included stints working with homeless youth and helping to run one of the largest domestic violence shelters in the country, giving her perspective on what affects Arizona’s most vulnerable. Wolf also said that as the governor-elect prepares to take office, her team is developing plans to improve the way the state provides social services, including “addressing the racial disparities that have plagued the system for so long.”</p>\n<p>Still, Black community leaders in Phoenix continue to have concerns, saying that it has been challenging to effectively advocate for reforms across both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p>\n<p>For one thing, the metro area’s Black community — just 7% of its population — is sparse and spread out compared to that of similarly large U.S. cities. That makes it hard to organize around this common experience to make DCS a pressing political issue and hold its officials accountable.</p>\n<p>What’s more, sharing that you were investigated by child services remains more stigmatizing in many families than saying you’ve been stopped by the police.</p>\n<p>As a result, some local leaders said it took them a while to realize just how pervasive DCS’ presence is.</p>\n<p>Janelle Wood, founder and president/CEO of Phoenix’s Black Mothers Forum, said that when she started her community organization in 2016, she thought its members would mainly be focused on police violence and the criminalization of Black youth, which they have been to an extent. “But what kept coming up at meetings was DCS,” she said, noting that the confidentiality of the gatherings allowed for these conversations. “The most heart-wrenching stories — so many mothers had them.”</p>\n<p>Kenneth Smith, principal of a Phoenix alternative high school and a community organizer who works with the local chapter of the NAACP and a group of nonprofits in the city, said he doesn’t usually talk about this issue openly due to the stigma, even though he knows of several people who’ve had DCS cases.</p>\n<p>The statistics identified by ProPublica and NBC News, he said, are “like turning on the lights, and all of us are now standing in the room together saying, ‘What? You too?’”</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>What reporters have found is that child protective services agencies investigate the home lives of roughly 3.5 million American children each year, opening refrigerators and closets and searching kids’ bodies in almost every case. Yet they determine there was physical or sexual abuse in only about 5% of these investigations.</p>\n<p>And while Phoenix is an outlier, the racial disproportionality of this system is a national problem.</p>\n<p>Matthew Stewart, the son of the longtime senior pastor of Phoenix’s most prominent Black church, First Institutional Baptist, joined DCS as a case manager in 2009. He did so in part because he had an interest in social justice and youth mentorship from his upbringing.</p>\n<p>But in 2018, Stewart, by then a training supervisor, came across an internal agency spreadsheet showing a large racial disparity in Arizona’s foster care population, which mainly consists of children removed from their families following investigations. He hadn’t fully absorbed the problem until then.</p>\n<p>He was flooded with shame.</p>\n<p>Stewart quit two years later, after deciding he couldn’t achieve meaningful change from within the department. He has since founded a community organization, Our Sister Our Brother, which advocates helping families rather than separating them.</p>\n<p>Generational poverty and the resulting trauma within families have been “centuries in the making,” he said. Are parents supposed to believe that after DCS takes custody of their children, “these things will be solved?”</p>\n<p>“I simply don’t think DCS is the agency to do this,” he said.</p>\n<p>One of the parents whom Stewart has partnered with is Tyra Smith, of nearby Mesa, who now works for his growing group as a parent advocate.</p>\n<p>In 2020, Smith left her four sons (triplets who were 7 as well as a 4-year-old) in her apartment for roughly 20 minutes, according to a case report. She said she was going for a walk to calm down after a heated argument by phone with her sister, who then called the police on her.</p>\n<p>While she was away, a police officer arrived and called DCS because she wasn’t there. Responding to her alleged lack of supervision and her growing anger about the ensuing encounter, the department removed all of her boys that night, agency records show.</p>\n<p>As often happens in the child protection system, this temporary removal led to a broader DCS inquiry into Smith’s mental health history, her troubled relationship with her ex, her marijuana use (which is legal in Arizona) and the tidiness of her home, records show. Based on these concerns, the department kept custody of the boys for a year and a half before returning them.</p>\n<p>Smith said that when she was growing up, her own mother underwent such an investigation, and that several of her friends from school, all Black, have since endured one as new parents.</p>\n<p>Now, she worries about her sons getting arrested or shot when they are older; when that happens to Black men, she pointed out, the news reports often say, “Oh, their childhood, they were ‘in the system.’”</p>\n<p>“It becomes a generational curse,” Smith said.</p>\n<p>ProPublica and NBC News presented DCS spokesperson Darren DaRonco with the names and anecdotes of the families described in this article, and he checked with agency leadership and case records and said that all of them were indeed investigated and that there was nothing inaccurate in their recounting of events. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arizona law<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, he noted, would allow him to clarify or correct anything that is factually wrong.</p>\n<p>In interviews, Katherine Guffey, executive consultant to DCS’ director, pointed to additional steps that their team has taken to address the disproportionality issue, especially since the racial justice movement following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.</p>\n<p>The department, said Guffey, who is white, has been incorporating the feedback of Black employees who formed a disparity committee, including Stewart before he left, helping them to write a charter and create an action plan. Staff have also taken part in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->workshop on the systemic causes of racial inequity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as well as an empathy training developed by Arizona State University professors.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, DCS helped convene a confidential two-hour focus group of a dozen Black people to hear how the department’s frequent involvement with families has affected them. The child welfare consulting firm Casey Family Programs has been brought in to hold continuing discussions.</p>\n<p>And the agency plans to start a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cultural Brokers program<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to ensure that a trusted community member of the same race is present upon parents’ contact with caseworkers.</p>\n<p>Critics say that while these are positive moves, no proposals have been made that would rein in the fundamental power of this agency, which has a billion-dollar budget, to remove children from their loved ones.</p>\n<p>As Stewart put it, “We have a culture that says Black families need to be watched and if we don’t agree with the things that are going on with them, we are the saviors of these children and are charged with punishing their parents.”</p>\n<p>Until that fundamental outlook of the child welfare system changes, he said, some of the well-intended steps being taken may amount to just restating or even perpetuating the problem.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>These families were soon forced to live in South Phoenix via redlining and racial covenants, which blocked them from renting or owning property anywhere else.</p>\n<p>Yet despite the injustice of residential segregation, said Rod Grimes, a scholar of Arizona Black history, it did create a sense of Black density in a town that still had few Black people. Once families were able to move, many heading to the suburbs, he said, some of that strength in numbers fell away.</p>\n<p>Today, Black residents of metro Phoenix are geographically and therefore politically diffuse. Without either the powerful voting blocs that exist in some parts of the South or the sense of protection of living in a majority-Black urban neighborhood elsewhere, they are more likely to be surrounded by white neighbors, teachers and health care workers whom they fear could call DCS on them, many said in interviews. They are also less likely to have the legislative representation that could conduct oversight of the department or fight for better social services to help prevent child welfare cases.</p>\n<p>Even after the November election, Arizona has just two Black state legislators out of 90 — the same number as in 1950.</p>\n<p>The result, said Clottee Hammons, an Arizona history expert and the creative director of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Emancipation Arts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is a business-oriented white leadership class whom she and other Black Arizonans feel cannot relate to what it is like to raise a Black child, let alone on a low income.</p>\n<p>Due to this experiential gap in the halls of power, critics say, the state Legislature rarely addresses concerns specific to Black families, instead focusing on topics of interest to many white voters, like school choice and border security.</p>\n<p>Nor have lawmakers created a well-funded, easily accessible statewide system that parents living in poverty (as well as mandated reporters of child neglect, like teachers) can call to get help. Many other states have invested heavily in such services, but in Arizona the main option is to call DCS, which comes with the possibility of family separation attached.</p>\n<p>In a statement, DaRonco, the department spokesperson, said of the parents and community members making this criticism, “We share their desire to reduce DCS presence in their homes by creating access to community-based supports that get them what they need without the stress of a DCS encounter.”</p>\n<p>Once DCS is involved, the emphasis is on child safety and possibly child removal rather than addressing problems at their root, as reflected in the agency’s funding structure. In fiscal year 2022, the department spent roughly $90 million on group homes and other congregate facilities for foster youth, $99 million on foster care and $278 million on adoptions, compared to just $15 million on prevention efforts and $29 million on in-home services for families themselves.</p>\n<p>DaRonco noted that top-line decisions about how DCS spends its funding are made by the Legislature, not the department. He added that the budget includes additional subsidies for parenting programs and substance use treatment, which can lead to family reunification.</p>\n<p>Much of the foster care and adoption money comes from the federal government <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the form of annual incentives<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>“I’m just telling you, people in the community feel like their babies are being sold and trafficked — that’s how easy it feels, and how profitable,” said Roy Dawson, executive director of the nonprofit Arizona Center for African American Resources and a leading Phoenix advocate for racial equity in the child welfare system.</p>\n<p>Dawson also said that all the well-meaning foster care nonprofits in Arizona, which exist in part because there is so much funding available for foster care in the state, help perpetuate the system’s vast size and reach.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear whether the election of Hobbs as governor will translate into a realignment of budget priorities at DCS, let alone a shift in the anti-poverty agenda at the Legislature, where Republicans continue to hold a majority.</p>\n<p>Many families and experts were also skeptical about the possibility of change because of the agency’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->long history<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of claiming to address its <!-- raw HTML omitted -->problems with race<!-- raw HTML omitted --> without <!-- raw HTML omitted -->making much progress<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>In 1995, the Arizona Republic published a story about child protective services with the sub-headline, “Blacks are overrepresented in Arizona’s system, study says.” The article went on to say, “Officials haven’t been able to find out why Arizona’s figures are 2.5 times the national average” and that “the state has formed a task force to examine why Blacks are having difficulty.”</p>\n<p>In 2008, Arizona reported to the federal government that it was developing an “Eliminating Racial Disproportionality and Disparity” strategy for its child welfare system, which would include technical assistance to evaluate Maricopa County’s data on race as well as a focus group and a training video.</p>\n<p>And in a 2014 DCS report, the agency said it was partnering with local churches as part of a racial “Gap Closing Collaborative.”</p>\n<p>“I can say with certainty that many DCS and previous CPS administrations have seen this information and been aware of it,” Guffey acknowledged, referring to the former name of the department.</p>\n<p>Dana Burns, a mom, musician and founder of the child welfare advocacy organization A Permanent Voice Foundation in South Phoenix, says that DCS’ pervasiveness in the community feels of a piece with a larger anti-Black attitude that she and other parents face in this state, from officials and neighbors alike.</p>\n<p>“It’s Arizona,” she said. “It’s an attitude that we were never supposed to be here.”</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Department data show that its frontline staff are most often white and disproportionately in their 20s, which reflects national trends. Many said in interviews that this was their first or second job out of college, and a large proportion do not have children themselves. Turnover at the agency has also been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->notoriously high<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, further lowering the average experience level.</p>\n<p>As a result, the typical scenario is a white person with little or no parenting experience entering a Black home and having minimal time, by the nature of the job, to make a judgment as to whether what is going on there is dangerous for kids.</p>\n<p>“It felt like we were on display, like they had a white glove on checking everything. And I had to smile and say good morning,” said Tressie King, who lives with her husband Jamel and their 13-year-old adoptive son in the suburb of Chandler. (King was accused of briefly leaving her child, who is autistic, unattended in her car while she ran in to a store, an allegation that case documents show was ruled unfounded but only after several inspections of their home.)</p>\n<p>“It felt like they were checking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me<!-- raw HTML omitted --> out, not my child,” she said. “I said if I am being made to feel ashamed, how is that good for the kid?”</p>\n<p>Many Black parents also said that if they get combative, precisely because the most precious thing in their life may be about to be taken from them, their anger is too often interpreted as a potential threat.</p>\n<p>Sarah Encarnacion, a DCS child safety specialist from 2019 to 2021, said her goal was always to keep families together and for them to feel she was a trusted presence. But she acknowledged that as “a small, petite white woman,” she was “responsible for preparing and educating myself on how to enter this home where I’m such a foreign entity.”</p>\n<p>DaRonco, the spokesperson, said that DCS has several initiatives to “change the power dynamic” between its staff and the families they work with. These include holding “team decision making” meetings near the beginning of an investigation, so that parents — and any friends, neighbors, teachers, clergy or others they want with them in the room — can have more of a say in the process.</p>\n<p>There are also differences in cultural attitudes toward corporal punishment, which is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more common on average<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Black families. Many Black parents and children interviewed for this article distinguished between what they called a whooping and abuse, with some parents saying they would rather spank a child, which is legal in Arizona, than risk the child getting out of line and experiencing something far worse at the hands of a police officer.</p>\n<p>“Nine times out of 10, parents raise their kids how their parents raised them,” said Richards, the Phoenix mother accused at the hospital, who has since become an advocate around the child welfare issue. “If the state is not agreeing with that way of raising kids, the solution is just to take the children every time? Every generation?”</p>\n<p>Richards and many others said DCS’ prevalence can eventually cause insidious damage to relationships between Black parents and their children, who sometimes threaten to call DCS on each other when they’re in normal family disputes.</p>\n<p>“That’s messed up,” she said, but the agency has become “so much a part of our lives that it’s a real thing to say.”</p>\n<p>In part because of her struggles with the child welfare system, Richards said that she and her family are planning to relocate again, likely leaving Arizona next year.</p>\n<p>Stephan Muhammad, a chef who lives in a suburban development in South Phoenix, agrees that no matter what DCS is now doing to address racial disproportionality, its harms linger in Black families like his.</p>\n<p>Muhammad had his children taken from him by the department twice; they were placed in foster care, including group homes where <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they say they experienced repeated violence<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for about two years in each case. The first time was based on a neglect allegation that he left his four youngest at home while he picked up his oldest daughter at kindergarten just across a nearby park. The second was for spanking his son, who was nearly 9 at the time, for getting in trouble at school — which the agency said was child abuse, according to Muhammad, his family members and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reporting by the Arizona Republic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>In both cases, a judge ultimately returned them home.</p>\n<p>“I missed years of my childhood,” said one of his daughters, Sierra, 12, who was separated from her siblings while in state custody. “If I could talk to the head of DCS, I would say don’t take my father from me ever again.”</p>\n<p>In an interview at Muhammad’s house, in front of a wall-sized calendar on which one of his children had written in the square of his birthday, “aka Big Head Day,” he said that he obviously has been overjoyed to have them all back. Still, he said he feels a trepidation that thousands of Black parents across Phoenix must be coping with every day: Is he in fact a bad parent?</p>\n<p>“It’s impossible not to internalize,” he said. “It’s an attack on who you are as a parent in every way.”</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

She was pregnant at the time.\n\nBefore arriving here, Richards, like most Americans, never thought of child protective services as having a major presence in people’s lives, unless they’ve committed some sort of clear-cut child abuse. As a Black mother, she was more concerned about her kids encountering the police someday.\n\nBut within months, she found herself being investigated by the Arizona Department of Child Safety — based on the initial result of a drug test administered to her newborn daughter at the hospital, according to DCS case records she shared with ProPublica and NBC News.\n\nIt is not hospital policy to test for drugs after all births, but staff told her that she and her child were being screened because she was from out of town, she said. Richards, who tested negative for substances herself, believes the reason was the color of her skin.\n\nDCS then prohibited her from being alone with her baby for five days while a caseworker interrogated her about her marital status, whether she received food stamps and how she usually handles stress, the records show. The investigator also inspected her other six children’s bodies and questioned them for hours about their chores, their meals, their mom’s employment and more.\n\nThen, the department learned that there had been a false positive on the test and deemed the case unfounded, according to the records.\n\n“They never explained or apologized,” Richards said.\n\nJust months later, Richards, a case manager for a behavioral health care company, was investigated again, when she sought medical care after her daughter fell off a couch. That allegation of child maltreatment, too, was unfounded, according to a DCS spokesperson.\n\nThe department declined to comment further on the two cases.\n\nRichards now feels intense dread when any of her children have even a minor injury or come down sick, fearing that DCS will show up again if she takes them to the doctor.\n\nAnd in the years since her own experiences with Arizona’s child welfare system, she said, two of her family members in Phoenix, as well as a neighbor and a client at her job, have also endured these investigations of their parenting. All of them are Black.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, the last full year of federal child welfare statistics available before the pandemic, DCS investigated the family lives of 1 of every 3 Black children in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous county and home to Phoenix, according to an <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-child-welfare-investigation-data\">analysis by ProPublica and NBC News</a> of data obtained from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect.\n\nLast year, a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2106272118\">study published by the National Academy of Sciences</a> used similar data to project that by the time Black children in Maricopa County turn 18, there’s a 63% chance that they will see their parents investigated by child services, the highest rate of any of the 20 largest counties in the nation.\n\nPut another way, more Black children in metro Phoenix will go through a child maltreatment investigation than won’t.\n\nThat’s significantly more likely than <a href=\"https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306259\">a Black teen being stopped by the police</a> — an issue that has gained far more attention in recent years — according to multiple studies and interviews with criminal justice data experts.\n\nOver the past year, ProPublica and NBC News have interviewed more than 30 Black parents across the Phoenix region who’ve faced a child welfare case, as well as several of their children and an additional nine teenagers who experienced DCS investigations.\n\nSome of the parents were working single dads or moms, like Richards, many of them living in the historically Black neighborhood of South Phoenix. Some were middle-class couples in the cactus-lined gated communities that dot suburbs like Mesa and Glendale. Some were adoptive parents, or extended family members caring for a child.\n\nAlmost all described a system so omnipresent among Black families that it has created a kind of communitywide dread: of that next knock on the door, of that next <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/child-welfare-search-seizure-without-warrants\">warrantless search of their home</a>. And many expressed disbelief that it was so easy for the state government to enter their family realm and potentially remove their kids from them.\n\nBlack families and their advocates said DCS’ ubiquity does not just take the form of unnecessary investigations in which racial bias may have played a role, as Richards believed happened in her case. It’s also a product, in some cases, of public policy choices in Arizona that take a punitive rather than preventative approach toward Black parents, many of whom are struggling under the legacy of racism, a lack of inherited wealth and a slashed social safety net.\n\nThe state — the last in the nation to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday, in 1992 — spends a majority of its welfare budget on <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/a-mother-needed-welfare-instead-the-state-used-welfare-funds-to-take-her-son/amp\">DCS investigations</a><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/a-mother-needed-welfare-instead-the-state-used-welfare-funds-to-take-her-son/amp\"> rather than on direct assistance</a> to families in need, as ProPublica reported last year.\n\nThese priorities are borne out in the data.\n\nOnly 2% of children in Maricopa County whose families were accused of child maltreatment from 2015 to 2019 were ultimately determined or suspected by caseworkers to be victims of any form of physical or sexual abuse following an investigation, one of the lowest rates among large counties in the U.S.\n\nBut 15% allegedly experienced neglect, a term encompassing parenting problems typically associated with poverty, including a lack of decent housing, child care, food, clothing, medical care or mental health treatment. The category also includes alcohol and drug use, which numerous studies have found are more policed but no more common among Black or low-income people than other groups.\n\nRoughly 20% of Black people in Maricopa County are living below the poverty line, compared to about 13% of all county residents, though having money should not be thought of as a requirement for good parenting, family advocates said.\n\nIn an interview, the director of DCS, Mike Faust, said the data used for this article is based on a stretch of time, 2015 through 2019, that <a href=\"https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/not-suitable-for-children-can-arizonas-broken-child-welfare-system-ever-be-fixed-7417413\">began with a caseload crisis</a> for the department. Over that period, he said, the agency made sweeping changes, including improving its intake and risk assessment tools in order to reduce subjective decision-making and unnecessary investigations.\n\n“We’ve gone from what I think most people would describe as the worst-performing child protection agency in the country to one that — I don’t know if you’ll ever have a high-performer child protection agency, given the nature of the work we do — but it’s drastically different,” said Faust, who is white and has led the agency since 2019.\n\nYet the most recent available federal data through September 2020 shows that while it is true that DCS has reduced the overall number of families it looks into statewide, the decline did not improve — and in fact worsened — the racial disparity.\n\nAlthough 7,400 fewer white children were the subject of investigations completed from the 2016 to 2020 fiscal years, the number of Black kids whose parents were investigated dropped by less than 100. (Some children did not have a race identified.)\n\n“It didn’t have an immediate impact on just African American children,” Faust acknowledged. “The commitment that I make is to continue to stay engaged as an organization. And trust me, these are some challenging conversations to be in. It’s been difficult. But you’ve got to keep coming back to the table regardless of, at times, that people share that raw emotion.”\n\nFaust, a conservative Republican with a private-sector background, may be out of a job by next spring. The election last month of Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, as Arizona governor likely means that DCS will have a new leader and possibly a new approach to racial disproportionality in the coming years.\n\nIn a statement, Joe Wolf, a spokesperson for Hobbs’ transition, pointed out that her career has included stints working with homeless youth and helping to run one of the largest domestic violence shelters in the country, giving her perspective on what affects Arizona’s most vulnerable. Wolf also said that as the governor-elect prepares to take office, her team is developing plans to improve the way the state provides social services, including “addressing the racial disparities that have plagued the system for so long.”\n\nStill, Black community leaders in Phoenix continue to have concerns, saying that it has been challenging to effectively advocate for reforms across both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nFor one thing, the metro area’s Black community — just 7% of its population — is sparse and spread out compared to that of similarly large U.S. cities. That makes it hard to organize around this common experience to make DCS a pressing political issue and hold its officials accountable.\n\nWhat’s more, sharing that you were investigated by child services remains more stigmatizing in many families than saying you’ve been stopped by the police.\n\nAs a result, some local leaders said it took them a while to realize just how pervasive DCS’ presence is.\n\nJanelle Wood, founder and president/CEO of Phoenix’s Black Mothers Forum, said that when she started her community organization in 2016, she thought its members would mainly be focused on police violence and the criminalization of Black youth, which they have been to an extent. “But what kept coming up at meetings was DCS,” she said, noting that the confidentiality of the gatherings allowed for these conversations. “The most heart-wrenching stories — so many mothers had them.”\n\nKenneth Smith, principal of a Phoenix alternative high school and a community organizer who works with the local chapter of the NAACP and a group of nonprofits in the city, said he doesn’t usually talk about this issue openly due to the stigma, even though he knows of several people who’ve had DCS cases.\n\nThe statistics identified by ProPublica and NBC News, he said, are “like turning on the lights, and all of us are now standing in the room together saying, ‘What? You too?’”\n<h3>“It Becomes a Generational Curse”</h3>\nThis year, ProPublica and NBC News <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/mandatory-reporting-strains-systems-punishes-poor-families\">have been investigating</a><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/child-welfare-search-seizure-without-warrants\">child welfare in the U.S.</a>\n\nWhat reporters have found is that child protective services agencies investigate the home lives of roughly 3.5 million American children each year, opening refrigerators and closets and searching kids’ bodies in almost every case. Yet they determine there was physical or sexual abuse in only about 5% of these investigations.\n\nAnd while Phoenix is an outlier, the racial disproportionality of this system is a national problem.\n\nMatthew Stewart, the son of the longtime senior pastor of Phoenix’s most prominent Black church, First Institutional Baptist, joined DCS as a case manager in 2009. He did so in part because he had an interest in social justice and youth mentorship from his upbringing.\n\nBut in 2018, Stewart, by then a training supervisor, came across an internal agency spreadsheet showing a large racial disparity in Arizona’s foster care population, which mainly consists of children removed from their families following investigations. He hadn’t fully absorbed the problem until then.\n\nHe was flooded with shame.\n\nStewart quit two years later, after deciding he couldn’t achieve meaningful change from within the department. He has since founded a community organization, Our Sister Our Brother, which advocates helping families rather than separating them.\n\nGenerational poverty and the resulting trauma within families have been “centuries in the making,” he said. Are parents supposed to believe that after DCS takes custody of their children, “these things will be solved?”\n\n“I simply don’t think DCS is the agency to do this,” he said.\n\nOne of the parents whom Stewart has partnered with is Tyra Smith, of nearby Mesa, who now works for his growing group as a parent advocate.\n\nIn 2020, Smith left her four sons (triplets who were 7 as well as a 4-year-old) in her apartment for roughly 20 minutes, according to a case report. She said she was going for a walk to calm down after a heated argument by phone with her sister, who then called the police on her.\n\nWhile she was away, a police officer arrived and called DCS because she wasn’t there. Responding to her alleged lack of supervision and her growing anger about the ensuing encounter, the department removed all of her boys that night, agency records show.\n\nAs often happens in the child protection system, this temporary removal led to a broader DCS inquiry into Smith’s mental health history, her troubled relationship with her ex, her marijuana use (which is legal in Arizona) and the tidiness of her home, records show. Based on these concerns, the department kept custody of the boys for a year and a half before returning them.\n\nSmith said that when she was growing up, her own mother underwent such an investigation, and that several of her friends from school, all Black, have since endured one as new parents.\n\nNow, she worries about her sons getting arrested or shot when they are older; when that happens to Black men, she pointed out, the news reports often say, “Oh, their childhood, they were ‘in the system.’”\n\n“It becomes a generational curse,” Smith said.\n\nProPublica and NBC News presented DCS spokesperson Darren DaRonco with the names and anecdotes of the families described in this article, and he checked with agency leadership and case records and said that all of them were indeed investigated and that there was nothing inaccurate in their recounting of events. <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/arizona/2005/title8/00807.html\">Arizona law</a>, he noted, would allow him to clarify or correct anything that is factually wrong.\n\nIn interviews, Katherine Guffey, executive consultant to DCS’ director, pointed to additional steps that their team has taken to address the disproportionality issue, especially since the racial justice movement following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.\n\nThe department, said Guffey, who is white, has been incorporating the feedback of Black employees who formed a disparity committee, including Stewart before he left, helping them to write a charter and create an action plan. Staff have also taken part in a <a href=\"https://www.joycejamesconsulting.com/\">workshop on the systemic causes of racial inequity</a>, as well as an empathy training developed by Arizona State University professors.\n\nEarlier this year, DCS helped convene a confidential two-hour focus group of a dozen Black people to hear how the department’s frequent involvement with families has affected them. The child welfare consulting firm Casey Family Programs has been brought in to hold continuing discussions.\n\nAnd the agency plans to start a <a href=\"https://culturalbrokerfa.com/\">Cultural Brokers program</a> to ensure that a trusted community member of the same race is present upon parents’ contact with caseworkers.\n\nCritics say that while these are positive moves, no proposals have been made that would rein in the fundamental power of this agency, which has a billion-dollar budget, to remove children from their loved ones.\n\nAs Stewart put it, “We have a culture that says Black families need to be watched and if we don’t agree with the things that are going on with them, we are the saviors of these children and are charged with punishing their parents.”\n\nUntil that fundamental outlook of the child welfare system changes, he said, some of the well-intended steps being taken may amount to just restating or even perpetuating the problem.\n<h3>Is This Just Arizona?</h3>\nArizona was a Confederate territory, whose early leaders had business ties to and a sense of common cause with the slave states of the Deep South. Its first major wave of Black residents were largely recruited to the Phoenix area from Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma starting in the 1910s and ’20s, to work in cotton camps.\n\nThese families were soon forced to live in South Phoenix via redlining and racial covenants, which blocked them from renting or owning property anywhere else.\n\nYet despite the injustice of residential segregation, said Rod Grimes, a scholar of Arizona Black history, it did create a sense of Black density in a town that still had few Black people. Once families were able to move, many heading to the suburbs, he said, some of that strength in numbers fell away.\n\nToday, Black residents of metro Phoenix are geographically and therefore politically diffuse. Without either the powerful voting blocs that exist in some parts of the South or the sense of protection of living in a majority-Black urban neighborhood elsewhere, they are more likely to be surrounded by white neighbors, teachers and health care workers whom they fear could call DCS on them, many said in interviews. They are also less likely to have the legislative representation that could conduct oversight of the department or fight for better social services to help prevent child welfare cases.\n\nEven after the November election, Arizona has just two Black state legislators out of 90 — the same number as in 1950.\n\nThe result, said Clottee Hammons, an Arizona history expert and the creative director of <a href=\"https://emancipationartsazllcs.wordpress.com/about/\">Emancipation Arts</a>, is a business-oriented white leadership class whom she and other Black Arizonans feel cannot relate to what it is like to raise a Black child, let alone on a low income.\n\nDue to this experiential gap in the halls of power, critics say, the state Legislature rarely addresses concerns specific to Black families, instead focusing on topics of interest to many white voters, like school choice and border security.\n\nNor have lawmakers created a well-funded, easily accessible statewide system that parents living in poverty (as well as mandated reporters of child neglect, like teachers) can call to get help. Many other states have invested heavily in such services, but in Arizona the main option is to call DCS, which comes with the possibility of family separation attached.\n\nIn a statement, DaRonco, the department spokesperson, said of the parents and community members making this criticism, “We share their desire to reduce DCS presence in their homes by creating access to community-based supports that get them what they need without the stress of a DCS encounter.”\n\nOnce DCS is involved, the emphasis is on child safety and possibly child removal rather than addressing problems at their root, as reflected in the agency’s funding structure. In fiscal year 2022, the department spent roughly $90 million on group homes and other congregate facilities for foster youth, $99 million on foster care and $278 million on adoptions, compared to just $15 million on prevention efforts and $29 million on in-home services for families themselves.\n\nDaRonco noted that top-line decisions about how DCS spends its funding are made by the Legislature, not the department. He added that the budget includes additional subsidies for parenting programs and substance use treatment, which can lead to family reunification.\n\nMuch of the foster care and adoption money comes from the federal government <a href=\"https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cb/algipp-earning-history-by-state.pdf\">in the form of annual incentives</a>.\n\n“I’m just telling you, people in the community feel like their babies are being sold and trafficked — that’s how easy it feels, and how profitable,” said Roy Dawson, executive director of the nonprofit Arizona Center for African American Resources and a leading Phoenix advocate for racial equity in the child welfare system.\n\nDawson also said that all the well-meaning foster care nonprofits in Arizona, which exist in part because there is so much funding available for foster care in the state, help perpetuate the system’s vast size and reach.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the election of Hobbs as governor will translate into a realignment of budget priorities at DCS, let alone a shift in the anti-poverty agenda at the Legislature, where Republicans continue to hold a majority.\n\nMany families and experts were also skeptical about the possibility of change because of the agency’s <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23322915-clipping_104709368\">long history</a> of claiming to address its <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23322946-cfs-apsr-2008\">problems with race</a> without <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23322916-statepubs_24763\">making much progress</a>.\n\nIn 1995, the Arizona Republic published a story about child protective services with the sub-headline, “Blacks are overrepresented in Arizona’s system, study says.” The article went on to say, “Officials haven’t been able to find out why Arizona’s figures are 2.5 times the national average” and that “the state has formed a task force to examine why Blacks are having difficulty.”\n\nIn 2008, Arizona reported to the federal government that it was developing an “Eliminating Racial Disproportionality and Disparity” strategy for its child welfare system, which would include technical assistance to evaluate Maricopa County’s data on race as well as a focus group and a training video.\n\nAnd in a 2014 DCS report, the agency said it was partnering with local churches as part of a racial “Gap Closing Collaborative.”\n\n“I can say with certainty that many DCS and previous CPS administrations have seen this information and been aware of it,” Guffey acknowledged, referring to the former name of the department.\n\nDana Burns, a mom, musician and founder of the child welfare advocacy organization A Permanent Voice Foundation in South Phoenix, says that DCS’ pervasiveness in the community feels of a piece with a larger anti-Black attitude that she and other parents face in this state, from officials and neighbors alike.\n\n“It’s Arizona,” she said. “It’s an attitude that we were never supposed to be here.”\n<h3>A White Idea of Family</h3>\nFor many of the Black families who spoke with ProPublica and NBC News, their first interaction with DCS was when an unfamiliar caseworker arrived at their door.\n\nDepartment data show that its frontline staff are most often white and disproportionately in their 20s, which reflects national trends. Many said in interviews that this was their first or second job out of college, and a large proportion do not have children themselves. Turnover at the agency has also been <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/06/28/arizona-child-welfare-agency-one-year/29370973/\">notoriously high</a>, further lowering the average experience level.\n\nAs a result, the typical scenario is a white person with little or no parenting experience entering a Black home and having minimal time, by the nature of the job, to make a judgment as to whether what is going on there is dangerous for kids.\n\n“It felt like we were on display, like they had a white glove on checking everything. And I had to smile and say good morning,” said Tressie King, who lives with her husband Jamel and their 13-year-old adoptive son in the suburb of Chandler. (King was accused of briefly leaving her child, who is autistic, unattended in her car while she ran in to a store, an allegation that case documents show was ruled unfounded but only after several inspections of their home.)\n\n“It felt like they were checking <em>me</em> out, not my child,” she said. “I said if I am being made to feel ashamed, how is that good for the kid?”\n\nMany Black parents also said that if they get combative, precisely because the most precious thing in their life may be about to be taken from them, their anger is too often interpreted as a potential threat.\n\nSarah Encarnacion, a DCS child safety specialist from 2019 to 2021, said her goal was always to keep families together and for them to feel she was a trusted presence. But she acknowledged that as “a small, petite white woman,” she was “responsible for preparing and educating myself on how to enter this home where I’m such a foreign entity.”\n\nDaRonco, the spokesperson, said that DCS has several initiatives to “change the power dynamic” between its staff and the families they work with. These include holding “team decision making” meetings near the beginning of an investigation, so that parents — and any friends, neighbors, teachers, clergy or others they want with them in the room — can have more of a say in the process.\n\nThere are also differences in cultural attitudes toward corporal punishment, which is <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2015/12/17/parenting-in-america/st_2015-12-17_parenting-09/\">more common on average</a> in Black families. Many Black parents and children interviewed for this article distinguished between what they called a whooping and abuse, with some parents saying they would rather spank a child, which is legal in Arizona, than risk the child getting out of line and experiencing something far worse at the hands of a police officer.\n\n“Nine times out of 10, parents raise their kids how their parents raised them,” said Richards, the Phoenix mother accused at the hospital, who has since become an advocate around the child welfare issue. “If the state is not agreeing with that way of raising kids, the solution is just to take the children every time? Every generation?”\n\nRichards and many others said DCS’ prevalence can eventually cause insidious damage to relationships between Black parents and their children, who sometimes threaten to call DCS on each other when they’re in normal family disputes.\n\n“That’s messed up,” she said, but the agency has become “so much a part of our lives that it’s a real thing to say.”\n\nIn part because of her struggles with the child welfare system, Richards said that she and her family are planning to relocate again, likely leaving Arizona next year.\n\nStephan Muhammad, a chef who lives in a suburban development in South Phoenix, agrees that no matter what DCS is now doing to address racial disproportionality, its harms linger in Black families like his.\n\nMuhammad had his children taken from him by the department twice; they were placed in foster care, including group homes where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSyG7gvGCSQ\">they say they experienced repeated violence</a>, for about two years in each case. The first time was based on a neglect allegation that he left his four youngest at home while he picked up his oldest daughter at kindergarten just across a nearby park. The second was for spanking his son, who was nearly 9 at the time, for getting in trouble at school — which the agency said was child abuse, according to Muhammad, his family members and <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-child-welfare/2019/11/06/how-stephan-mccray-regained-custody-his-kids-and-what-went-wrong-dcs/616071002/\">reporting by the Arizona Republic</a>.\n\nIn both cases, a judge ultimately returned them home.\n\n“I missed years of my childhood,” said one of his daughters, Sierra, 12, who was separated from her siblings while in state custody. “If I could talk to the head of DCS, I would say don’t take my father from me ever again.”\n\nIn an interview at Muhammad’s house, in front of a wall-sized calendar on which one of his children had written in the square of his birthday, “aka Big Head Day,” he said that he obviously has been overjoyed to have them all back. Still, he said he feels a trepidation that thousands of Black parents across Phoenix must be coping with every day: Is he in fact a bad parent?\n\n“It’s impossible not to internalize,” he said. “It’s an attack on who you are as a parent in every way.”\n\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://pixel.propublica.org/pixel.js\" async=\"\"></script>\n",

Yang's letter painted a picture of Basecamp's leaders that looked very familiar to me from my own experience with similar people in the industry.  The letter is well-worth reading in full, but here is paragraph that makes it clear Basecamp's leaders were no different than those at other companies they'd criticized for years:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>\"But there were also some yellow flags.

The founders knew about the existence of this list for years, and predictably, the names that Basecamp customer service reps found ripe for mockery included Asian and African names.  Particularly because of how public and opinionated Fried and Hanson have been regarding workplace culture--to the extent of having written five books on the subject, including a New York Times bestseller--and held up their own company as an example of how to do things better, it was (and still is) quite difficult to ignore the rank hypocrisy of their choice to shut down internal discussion of a significant cultural failure that they allowed to persist for years.  The company all-hands called by the co-founders to try and mitigate the blowback from their decisions instead resulted in <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418208/basecamp-all-hands-meeting-employee-resignations-buyouts-implosion\" target=\"_blank\">the departure of one-third of the entire company</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over time, marginalized groups (and some of their allies) have mastered online tools and social media and leveraged them to amplify their voices.

The same thin-skinned reaction to criticism displayed by Fried and Hansson has been even more on display from Elon Musk.  He's fired those who tried to correct his ill-informed assertions regarding the ways the tech behind Twitter actually works--and mocked the skills and intelligence of the people he fired after the fact.  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-start-layoffs-friday-morning-internal-email-2022-11-04/\" target=\"_blank\">Musk blames \"activists\" for the precipitous drop in ad revenue</a> instead of being accountable for his own poor decision-making.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reaction in various quarters to Musk's floundering incompetence as CEO of Twitter has been very telling.

Loury and McWhorter are regularly quoted by white conservatives too cowardly to share the stereotypical views of black people they already believed anyway without a black conservative to hide behind.  We're already starting to see layoffs across tech, and as economic conditions change and COVID-19 (hopefully) recedes, these CEOs almost certainly see an opportunity to re-establish their worldview within their spheres of control without having to account for marginalized people.

Face ID came out with the iPhone X and expanded to other parts of Apple's hardware lineup, and YubiKeys have become far more prevalent in usage.  The previous iteration of this blog didn't have MFA protecting admin access, but the current one does.  The websites that give me access to my brokerage account and various retirement accounts are now all protected by some form of MFA.  The issue highlighted in the tweet above is specific to using SMS as the second factor for gaining access to your Twitter account.  The service responsible for sending the code you type in to verify that you're the legitimate accountholder was turned off.  So for those users who only had <strong>Text message </strong>as their Two-factor authentication option, they might not have been able to get back into their account as a result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In my case, I wasn't impacted because I'd actually turned <strong>Text message </strong>off as a second factor in favor of two other options: <strong>Authentication app</strong>, and <strong>Security key</strong>.  Authentication app options include <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;pli=1\" target=\"_blank\">Google Authenticator</a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Authenticator</a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://authy.com\" target=\"_blank\">Authy</a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://vip.symantec.com\" target=\"_blank\">Symantec VIP</a>, and many others.  Once installed on your mobile phone, they all work in a similar way: they generate a random sequence of 6-8 numbers every 30 seconds.  If you've set up an online account to require such a number for access, you must provide it (along with your username and password) before the 30 seconds expires to gain access.  Security key eliminates the stand-alone app requirement in favor of plugging a physical key (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5ci/\" target=\"_blank\">like the Yubikey 5Ci</a> which I use) into whatever laptop or mobile phone where you're trying to access an account and touching it to generate a code that give you access.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MFA options in descending order of difficulty for hackers to breach:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Security key</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Authentication app</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>SMS<br>\n</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To be clear--SMS as a second factor is much better than nothing.  But if you don't also secure the account you have with your cellphone provider with MFA and/or a PIN, a determined attacker could take over your account and redirect the SMS message to a device they control.  An authentication app is much more secure, but as I discovered to my chagrin when researching this post, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twilio-breach-let-hackers-gain-access-to-authy-2fa-accounts/\" target=\"_blank\">not impenetrable</a>.  The security key option is the only one of the three that requires physical access to you (and/or your stuff) in order to steal the thing necessary to get access to your accounts.  For that reason, I've been switching my online accounts to use the security key option wherever it's available.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The advice from seven years ago to use a password manager still holds.  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://1password.com\" target=\"_blank\">1Password</a> remains my preferred option for this.

limited to things that could cause someone to recall a traumatic experience they had.  My primary takeaways from <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/triggered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one piece in particular</a> was that broader, more casual use of the term \"triggered\" ended up both being conflated with people being \"too sensitive\" and conflating trauma with mere discomfort.  \"Conflating trauma with mere discomfort\" ends up being a great summation of the way far too many white people still respond to black people merely describing the racism they've survived.\n\nMastodon (and the Fediverse)'s turn in the spotlight, and the negative experiences of at least a few black people on it I follow make it a microcosm of both the best and the worst aspects of tech more broadly.  A few of the best aspects: <a href=\"https://time.com/6229230/mastodon-eugen-rochko-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">software a young man named Eugen Rochko first started writing in 2016</a>, has held up rather well all things considered against a significant increase in usage and attention.  It's <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">open source</a>, so not only can you see how it works, you can suggest changes, or even make a copy of it and make changes yourself if you have the time and expertise.  It uses a <a href=\"https://github.com/topics/activitypub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decentralized social networking protocol</a> that doesn't just interoperate with other Mastodon servers, but with other social networking applications that use the same protocol.  Despite the good--which is significant--Mastodon is just as susceptible to some of the negative aspects of the for-profit tech industry it intends to be an alternative to.  The most obvious negative aspect is the gatekeeping.  Despite beginning my professional career just a few years after the founder of Mastodon was born, it would take over 15 years of that career before I would find an employer where there was more than one other person who looked like me writing software for a living.  Software engineers who are Hispanic or Latino aren't that much less rare than black software engineers.  Today, <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2022/statistics-show-women-in-technology-are-facing-new-headwinds.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the percentage of women in technical roles is projected to be around 25% by the end of this year</a>.  But the history of computing predates the machines that do it today, and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/history-human-computers-180972202/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a much higher percentage of those literal human computers were women</a>.  Those women who do persevere through the gatekeeping that would prevent them from entering the industry ultimately end up leaving at unfortunately high rates because of the hostility to women that still persists in too many work environments.\n\nTim Bray (co-author of the XML spec and contributor to numerous web standards), shared <a href=\"https://www.hughrundle.net/home-invasion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this piece</a> as one of his first posts on Mastodon.  I have no doubt that he meant well, and that the author of the piece meant well, but when you title a piece \"Home invasion\" when talking about new users of a platform you're used to, that comes across as incredibly hostile.  The same author that talks about trans and queer feminists building the tools, protocols, and culture of the fediverse makes not a single mention of people of color in his piece--not unlike the commercial tech companies in general, and Twitter in particular that are among the targets of his critique.  The entire piece is worth reading in full to understand the author's perspective, but I will pull quote and highlight one paragraph that seems most emblematic of the blind spot that some veteran Mastodon users appear to have:\n<blockquote>This attitude has moved with the new influx. Loudly proclaiming that content warnings are censorship, that functionality that has been deliberately unimplemented due to community safety concerns are \"missing\" or \"broken\", and that volunteer-run servers maintaining control over who they allow and under what conditions are \"exclusionary\". No consideration is given to <em>why</em> the norms and affordances of Mastodon and the broader fediverse exist, and whether the actor they are designed to protect against might be you. <strong>The Twitter people believe in the same fantasy of a \"public square\" as the person they are allegedly fleeing. Like fourteenth century Europeans, they bring the contagion with them as they flee.</strong>\n</blockquote>\nTo see yourself (as a new user of Mastodon and a long-time user of Twitter) be described as someone bringing contagion hits a lot differently when you've endured racism in real life as well as online, and when you've had to overcome--and are still overcoming--so many barriers in both places merely to be included, much less respected.  And were the author to be called on this huge blindspot publicly, I have no doubt that he would respond with the same sort of defensiveness that Dr. Prescod-Weinstein described, and that Timnit Gebru, another recent joiner of Mastodon has also described.\n\nAs I said at the start of this piece, my own experience with Mastodon has been a positive one so far.  Some of it is a function of having participated in online communities for decades (as far back as the Usenet newsgroups days), and even becoming a private beta tester one of the newer ones (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StackOverflow.com</a>) before it went public.  But those communities too had their gatekeepers, mansplainers, and jerks.  Certain open source projects are unfortunately no different in that regard either.  There's something to be said for understanding the pre-existing culture of a place--even if it is virtual.  That said, the idea that culture is static--and should remain so--is a perspective that it seems some Mastodon veterans would do well to change.  Otherwise, they risk perpetuating the same harms as commercial social media--just without the financial rewards.\n",

Sign up for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Big Story newsletter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to receive stories like this one in your inbox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Six days before a local runoff election last year in Frisco, a prosperous and growing suburb of Dallas, Brandon Burden paced the stage of KingdomLife Church. The pastor told congregants that demonic spirits were operating through members of the City Council.</p>\n<p>Grasping his Bible with both hands, Burden said God was working through his North Texas congregation to take the country back to its Christian roots. He lamented that he lacked jurisdiction over the state Capitol, where he had gone during the 2021 Texas legislative session to lobby for conservative priorities like expanded gun rights and a ban on abortion.</p>\n<p>“But you know what I got jurisdiction over this morning is an election coming up on Saturday,” Burden told parishioners. “I got a candidate that God wants to win. I got a mayor that God wants to unseat. God wants to undo. God wants to shift the balance of power in our city. And I have jurisdiction over that this morning.”</p>\n<p>What Burden said that day in May 2021 was a violation of a long-standing federal law barring churches and nonprofits from directly or indirectly participating in political campaigns, tax law experts told ProPublica and The Texas Tribune. Although the provision was mostly uncontroversial for decades after it passed in 1954, it has become a target for both evangelical churches and former President Donald Trump, who vowed to eliminate it.</p>\n<p>Burden’s sermon is among those at 18 churches identified by the news organizations over the past two years that appeared to violate the Johnson Amendment, a measure named after its author, former President Lyndon B. Johnson. Some pastors have gone so far as to paint candidates they oppose as demonic.</p>\n<p>At one point, churches fretted over losing their tax-exempt status for even unintentional missteps. But the IRS has largely abdicated its enforcement responsibilities as churches have become more brazen. In fact, the number of apparent violations found by ProPublica and the Tribune, and confirmed by three nonprofit tax law experts, are greater than the total number of churches the federal agency has investigated for intervening in political campaigns over the past decade, according to records obtained by the news organizations.</p>\n<p>In response to questions, an IRS spokesperson said that the agency “cannot comment on, neither confirm nor deny, investigations in progress, completed in the past nor contemplated.” Asked about enforcement efforts over the past decade, the IRS pointed the news organizations to annual reports that do not contain such information.</p>\n<p>Neither Burden nor KingdomLife responded to multiple interview requests or to emailed questions.</p>\n<p>Trump’s opposition to the law banning political activity by nonprofits “has given some politically-minded evangelical leaders a sense that the Johnson Amendment just isn’t really an issue anymore, and that they can go ahead and campaign for or against candidates or positions from the pulpit,” said David Brockman, a scholar in religion and public policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.</p>\n<p>Among the violations the newsrooms identified: In January, an Alaska pastor told his congregation that he was voting for a GOP candidate who is aiming to unseat <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, saying the challenger was the “only candidate for Senate that can flat-out preach.” During a May 15 sermon, a pastor in Rocklin, California, asked voters to get behind “a Christian conservative candidate” challenging Gov. Gavin Newsom. And in July, a New Mexico pastor called Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham “beyond evil” and “demonic” for supporting abortion access. He urged congregants to “vote her behind right out of office” and challenged the media to call him out for violating the Johnson Amendment.</p>\n<p>Andrew Whitehead, a sociologist at the University of Indiana-Purdue, who studies Christian nationalism, said the ramping up of political activity by churches could further polarize the country. “It creates hurdles for a healthy, functioning, pluralistic democratic society,” he said. “It’s really hard to overcome.”</p>\n<p>The Johnson Amendment does not prohibit churches from inviting political speakers or discussing positions that may seem partisan nor does it restrict voters from making faith-based decisions on who should represent them. But because donations to churches are tax-deductible and because churches don’t have to file financial disclosures with the IRS, without such a rule donors seeking to influence elections could go undetected, said Andrew Seidel, vice president of strategic communications for the advocacy group Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</p>\n<p>“If you pair the ability to wade into partisan politics with a total absence of financial oversight and transparency, you’re essentially creating super PACs that are black holes,” Seidel said.</p>\n<p>Churches have long balanced the tightrope of political involvement, and blatant violations have previously been rare. In the 1960s, the IRS investigated complaints that some churches abused their tax-exempt status by distributing literature that was hostile to the election of John F. Kennedy, the country’s first Catholic president. And in 2004, the federal agency audited All Saints Episcopal Church in California after a pastor gave an anti-war speech that imagined Jesus talking to presidential candidates George W. Bush and John Kerry. The pastor did not endorse a candidate but criticized the Iraq war.</p>\n<p>Some conservative groups have argued that Black churches are more politically active than their white evangelical counterparts but are not as heavily scrutinized. During the 1984 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Rev. Jesse L. Jackson was accused of turning Sunday sermons into campaign rallies and using Black churches to raise funds. In response to allegations of illegal campaigning, Jackson said at the time that strict guidelines were followed and denied violating the law.</p>\n<p>While some Black churches have crossed the line into political endorsements, the long legacy of political activism in these churches stands in sharp contrast to white evangelical churches, where some pastors argue devout Christians must take control of government positions, said Robert Wuthnow, the former director of the Princeton University Center for the Study of Religion.</p>\n<p>Wuthnow said long-standing voter outreach efforts inside Black churches, such as Souls to the Polls, which encourages voting on Sundays after church services, largely stay within the boundaries of the law.</p>\n<p>“The Black church has been so keenly aware of its marginalized position,” Wuthnow said. “The Black church, historically, was the one place where Black people could mobilize, could organize, could feel that they had some power at the local level. The white evangelical church has power. It’s in office. It’s always had power.”</p>\n<p>At the end of his two-hour sermon that May, Burden asserted that his church had a God-given power to choose lawmakers, and he asked others to join him onstage to “secure the gate over the city.”</p>\n<p>Burden and a handful of church members crouched down and held on to a rod, at times speaking in tongues. The pastor said intruders such as the mayor, who was not up for reelection last year but who supported one of the candidates in the race for City Council, would be denied access to the gates of the city.</p>\n<p>“Now this is bold, but I’m going to say it because I felt it from the Lord. I felt the Lord say, ‘Revoke the mayor’s keys to this gate,’” Burden said. “No more do you have the key to the city. We revoke your key this morning, Mr. Mayor.</p>\n<p>“We shut you out of the place of power,” Burden added. “The place of authority and influence.”</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Leading the probe was Rep. Gene Cox, a Georgia Democrat who had accused the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations, among others, of helping alleged Communists or Communist fronts. Cox died during the investigation, and the final report cleared the foundations of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>But a Republican member of the committee argued for additional scrutiny, and in July 1953, Congress established the House Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations. The committee focused heavily on liberal organizations, but it also investigated nonprofits such as the Facts Forum foundation, which was headed by Texas oilman H.L. Hunt, an ardent supporter of then-Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, a Republican who was best known for holding hearings to investigate suspected Communists.</p>\n<p>In July 1954, Johnson, who was then a senator, proposed an amendment to the U.S. tax code that would strip nonprofits of their tax-exempt status for “intervening” in political campaigns. The amendment sailed through Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower.</p>\n<p>Johnson never explained his intent. Opponents of the amendment, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as well as some academics<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, say Johnson was motivated by a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->desire to undercut conservative foundations<!-- raw HTML omitted --> such as the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government, founded by newspaper magnate Frank Gannett, which painted the Democrat as soft on communism and supported his opponent in the primary election. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Others have hypothesized<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that Johnson was hoping to head off a wider crackdown on nonprofit foundations.</p>\n<p>Over the next 40 years, the IRS stripped a handful of religious nonprofits of their tax-exempt status. None were churches.</p>\n<p>Then, just four days before the 1992 presidential election, Branch Ministries in New York ran two full-page ads in USA Today and The Washington Times urging voters to reject then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, in his challenge to Republican President George H.W. Bush.</p>\n<p>The ads proclaimed: “Christian Beware. Do not put the economy ahead of the Ten Commandments.” They asserted that Clinton violated scripture by supporting “abortion on demand,” homosexuality and the distribution of condoms to teenagers in public schools. Clinton, the ads said, was “openly promoting policies that are in rebellion to God’s laws.”</p>\n<p>The IRS revoked the church’s tax-exempt status, leading to a long legal battle that ended with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->U.S. appeals court siding with the federal agency<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>The case remains the only publicly known example of the IRS revoking the tax-exempt status of a church because of its political activity in nearly 70 years.

Michele Bachmann, a Republican from Minnesota.</p>\n<p>The court found that the IRS had not been following its own rules for a decade because it was tasked with notifying churches of their legal rights before any pending audits and was required to have an appropriately high-level official sign off on them. But a 1998 agency reorganization had eliminated the position, leaving lower IRS employees to initiate church investigations.</p>\n<p>Following the ruling, the IRS suspended its investigations into church political activity for five years, according to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2015 Government Accountability Office report<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>During the hiatus, a conservative Christian initiative called Pulpit Freedom Sunday flourished.

The goal, according to participants, was to trigger <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a lawsuit that would lead to the prohibition being ruled unconstitutional<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>The IRS never challenged participating churches, and the effort wound down without achieving its aim.</p>\n<p>In response to a Freedom of Information Act request from ProPublica and the Tribune last year, the IRS produced a severely redacted spreadsheet indicating the agency had launched inquiries into 16 churches since 2011. IRS officials shielded the results of the probes, and they have declined to answer specific questions.</p>\n<p>Despite the agency’s limited enforcement, Trump promised shortly after he took office that he would “totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.”</p>\n<p>As president, Trump tried unsuccessfully to remove the restrictions on church politicking through a 2017 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->executive order<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The move was largely symbolic because it simply ordered the government not to punish churches differently than it would any other nonprofit, according to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->legal filing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>Eliminating the Johnson Amendment would require congressional or judicial action.</p>\n<p>Although the IRS has not discussed its plans, it has taken procedural steps that would enable it to ramp up audits again if it chooses to.</p>\n<p>In 2019, more than two decades after eliminating the high-level position needed to sign off on action against churches, the IRS designated the commissioner of the agency’s tax-exempt and government entities division as the “appropriate high-level Treasury official” with the power to initiate a church audit.</p>\n<p>But Philip Hackney, a former IRS attorney and University of Pittsburgh tax law professor, said he doesn’t read too much into that. “I don’t see any reason to believe that the operation of the IRS has changed significantly.”</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Texas’ large evangelical population and history of activism in Black churches makes the state a focal point for debates over political activity, said Matthew Wilson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.</p>\n<p>“Combine all of that with the increasing competitiveness of Texas elections, and it’s no surprise that more and more Texas churches are taking on a political role,” he said. “Texas is a perfect arena for widespread, religiously motivated political activism.”</p>\n<p>The state also has a long history of politically minded pastors, Wuthnow said. Texas evangelical church leaders joined the fight in support of alcohol prohibition a century ago and spearheaded efforts to defeat Democrat Al Smith, the first Catholic to be nominated for president by a major party, in 1928. In the 1940s, evangelical fundamentalism began to grow in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p>\n<p>Today, North Texas remains home to influential pastors such as Robert Jeffress, who leads the First Baptist megachurch in Dallas. Jeffress was one of Trump’s most fervent supporters, appearing at campaign events, defending him on television news shows and stating that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he “absolutely” did not regret supporting the former president<!-- raw HTML omitted --> after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.</p>\n<p>Burden went a step further, urging followers to stock up on food and keep their guns loaded ahead of President Joe Biden’s inauguration. He told parishioners that “prophetic voices” had told him in 2016 that Trump would have eight consecutive years in office.</p>\n<p>The Frisco Conservative Coalition board <!-- raw HTML omitted -->voted to suspend<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Burden as chair for 30 days after criticism about his remarks.</p>\n<p>Burden called his comments “inartful” but claimed he was unfairly targeted for his views. “The establishment media is coming after me,” he said<!-- raw HTML omitted -->at the time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. “But it is not just about me. People of faith are under attack in this country.”</p>\n<p>Since then, Burden has repeatedly preached that the church has been designated by the Lord to decide who should serve in public office and “take dominion” over Frisco.</p>\n<p>As the runoff for the Frisco City Council approached last year, Burden supported Jennifer White, a local veterinarian. White had positioned herself as the conservative candidate in the nonpartisan race against Angelia Pelham, a Black human resources executive who had the backing of the Frisco mayor.</p>\n<p>White said she wasn’t in attendance during the May 2021 sermon in which Burden called her the “candidate that God wants to win.” She said she does not believe pastors should endorse candidates from the pulpit, but she welcomed churches becoming more politically active.</p>\n<p>“I think that the churches over the years have been a big pretty big disappointment to the candidates in that they won&rsquo;t take a political stance,” White said in an interview. “So I would love it if churches would go ahead and come out and actually discuss things like morality. Not a specific party, but at least make sure people know where the candidates stand on those issues. And how to vote based on that.”</p>\n<p>Pelham’s husband, local pastor Dono Pelham, also made a statement that violated the Johnson Amendment by “indirectly intervening” in the campaign, said Ellen Aprill, an emerita tax law professor at Loyola Marymount Law School in Los Angeles</p>\n<p>In May 2021, Pelham told his church that the race for a seat on the City Council had resulted in a runoff. He acknowledged that his church’s tax-exempt status prevented him from supporting candidates from the pulpit. Then, he added, “but you’ll get the message.”</p>\n<p>“It’s been declared for the two candidates who received the most votes, one of which is my wife,” Pelham said. “That’s just facts. That’s just facts. That’s just facts. And so a runoff is coming and every vote counts. Be sure to vote.”</p>\n<p>Pelham then asked the congregation: “How did I do? I did all right, didn’t I? You know I wanted to go a little further, but I didn’t do it.”</p>\n<p>Angelia Pelham, who co-founded Life-Changing Faith Christian Fellowship in 2008 with her husband, said the couple tried to avoid violating the Johnson Amendment. Both disagreed that her husband’s mention of her candidacy was a violation.</p>\n<p>“I think church and state should remain separate,” Angelia Pelham said in an interview, adding: “But I think there’s a lot of folks in the religious setting that just completely didn’t even consider the line. They erased it completely and lost sight of the Johnson Amendment.”</p>\n<p>She declined to discuss Burden’s endorsement of her opponent.</p>\n<p>In his sermon the morning after Pelham defeated his chosen candidate, Burden told parishioners that the church’s political involvement would continue.</p>\n<p>“So you’re like, but you lost last night? No, we set the stage for the future,” he said, adding “God is uncovering the demonic structure that is in this region.”</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Of the nearly 2,500 registered voters who were surveyed, 79% opposed getting rid of the Johnson Amendment. Only among Republican evangelical voters did a slight majority — 52% — favor loosening restrictions on church political activity.</p>\n<p>But such endorsements are taking place across the country, with some pastors calling for a debate about the Johnson Amendment.</p>\n<p>After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, New Mexico became an island of abortion access for women in Texas and other neighboring states.</p>\n<p>The issue raised the stakes in the upcoming Nov. 8 New Mexico governor’s race between incumbent Lujan Grisham, a supporter of abortion rights, and Republican challenger Mark Ronchetti, who advocates limiting access.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to fast become the No. 1 abortion place in all of America,” a pastor, Steve Smothermon, said during a July 10 sermon at Legacy Church in Albuquerque, which has an average weekly attendance of more than 10,000 people. Smotherman said the governor was “wicked and evil” and called her “a narcissist.”</p>\n<p>“And people think, ‘Why do you say that?’ Because I truly believe it. In fact, she’s beyond evil. It’s demonic,” Smothermon said.</p>\n<p>He later added: “Folks, when are we going to get appalled? When are we going to say, ‘Enough is enough’? When are we going to stop saying, ‘Well, you know, it’s a woman’s right to choose’? That’s such a lie.”</p>\n<p>Church attendees had a stark choice in the upcoming election, Smothermon said. “We have the Wicked Witch of the North. Or you have Mark Ronchetti.”</p>\n<p>The governor’s campaign declined to comment. Neither Legacy Church, Smothermon nor Ronchetti responded to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>The sermon was a “clear violation” of the Johnson Amendment, said Sam Brunson, a Loyola University Chicago law professor. But Smothermon showed no fear of IRS enforcement.</p>\n<p>Those who thought he crossed the line were “so stupid,” Smothermon said during the sermon. “You have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>In another example, pastors at a Fort Worth church named Mercy Culture have repeatedly endorsed candidates for local and statewide offices since its founding in 2019.</p>\n<p>“Now, obviously, churches don’t endorse candidates, but my name is Landon and I’m a person before I’m a pastor. And as an individual, I endorse Nate Schatzline,” the lead pastor, Landon Schott, said in a February sermon about a church member who was running to fill an open state representative seat.</p>\n<p>Johnson Amendment rules allow pastors to endorse in their individual capacity, as long as they are not at an official church function, which Schott was.</p>\n<p>In other services, Schott challenged critics to complain to the IRS about the church’s support of political candidates and said he wasn’t worried about losing the church’s tax-exempt status.</p>\n<p>“If you want it that bad, come and take it. And if you think that we will stop preaching the gospel, speaking truth over taxes, you got another thing coming for you,” Schott said in May.</p>\n<p>Schatzline, a member of Mercy Culture, received 65% of the vote in a May 24 runoff against the former mayor of the Dallas suburb of Southlake. He works for a separate nonprofit founded by Heather Schott, a pastor at Mercy Culture and the wife of Landon Schott.</p>\n<p>Schatzline said in an interview with ProPublica and the Tribune that Landon Schott, not the church, endorsed him. He added that the church sought legal advice on how to ensure that it was complying with the Johnson Amendment.</p>\n<p>“I think prayers can manifest into anything that God wants them to, but I would say that the community rallying behind me as individuals definitely manifested into votes,” Schatzline said.</p>\n<p>Mercy Culture also supported Tim O’Hare, a Republican running for Tarrant County judge, this year after he came out against the shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. His opponent in the primary had ordered churches and businesses to temporarily close when she was mayor of Fort Worth.</p>\n<p>O’Hare came to prominence as the mayor of suburban Farmers Branch, where he championed a city ordinance to prohibit landlords from renting to immigrants without legal status. A federal <!-- raw HTML omitted -->court declared the ordinance unconstitutional<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in 2010 after a legal battle that cost the city $6.6 million.</p>\n<p>O’Hare has pledged to hire an election integrity officer to oversee voting and “uncover election fraud.”</p>\n<p>“The Lord spoke to me and said, ‘Begin to pray for righteous judges in our city,’” Heather Schott said during a Feb. 13 service. “I am believing that Mr. Tim O’Hare is an answered prayer of what we have been petitioning heaven for for the last year and a half.”</p>\n<p>Neither Mercy Culture, Landon Schott nor Heather Schott responded to requests for comment. O’Hare also did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment.</p>\n<p>Schott’s comments were a prohibited endorsement, said Aprill, the emerita tax law professor at Loyola Marymount Law School in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t say ‘vote for him’ but is still an endorsement,” she said. “There’s no other way to understand the statement that O’Hare has answered prayers for righteous judges.”</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, O’Hare won his primary. He faces Deborah Peoples, a Democrat, on Nov. 8.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>“We’re not endorsing a candidate. We’re not doing that. But we just thought because they’re a member of the family of God, that you might want to know if someone in the family and this family of churches is running,” said Robert Morris, who leads the Gateway megachurch in Southlake and served as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->member of Trump’s evangelical advisory board<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>On the same day, Doug Page gave a similar message less than 5 miles away at First Baptist Grapevine.</p>\n<p>“And so what we decided to do is look within our church families and say, ‘Who do we know that’s running for office?’ Now, let me clarify with you. This is not an endorsement by us. We are not endorsing anyone. However, if you’re part of a family, you’d like to know if Uncle Bill is running for office, right? And so that’s all we’re going to do is simply inform you.”</p>\n<p>Saying that you are not endorsing a candidate “isn’t like a magic silver bullet that makes it so that you’re not endorsing them,” Brunson said.</p>\n<p>The churches’ coordination on messaging across the area is notable, according to University of Notre Dame tax law professor Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, who said he hadn’t before seen churches organizing to share lists of candidates.</p>\n<p>“I do think this strategy is new,” said Mayer, who has studied the Johnson Amendment for more than a decade. “I hadn’t heard of that before. It’s quite a sophisticated tactic.”</p>\n<p>Eight of the nine candidates mentioned by the pastors won their races.</p>\n<p>Mindy McClure, who ran for reelection to the Grapevine-Colleyville school board, said she thought church involvement contributed to her defeat in a June 5, 2021, runoff by about 4 percentage points. Her opponent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->campaigned on removing critical race theory<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from district curriculum, while McClure said students “weren’t being indoctrinated in any way, shape or form.” Critical race theory is a college-level academic theory that racism is embedded in legal systems.</p>\n<p>McClure said pastors endorsing from the pulpit creates “divisiveness” in the community.</p>\n<p>“Just because you attend a different church doesn’t mean that you’re more connected with God,” she said.</p>\n<p>Lawrence Swicegood, executive director of Gateway Media, said this month that the church doesn’t endorse candidates but “inform(s) our church family of other church family members who are seeking office to serve our community.” Page told ProPublica and the Tribune that “these candidates were named for information only.”</p>\n<p>Eleven days after responding to ProPublica and the Tribune in October, Morris once again told his church that he was not endorsing any candidates during the last Sunday sermon before early voting. Then, he again displayed the names of specific candidates on a screen and told parishioners to take screenshots with their cellphones.</p>\n<p>“We must vote,” he said. “I think we have figured that out in America, that the Christians sat on the sidelines for too long. And then all of a sudden they started teaching our children some pretty mixed up things in the schools. And we had no one to blame but ourselves. So let’s not let that happen. Especially at midterms.”</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

Sign up for <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/the-big-story?source=reprint&amp;placement=top-note\">The Big Story newsletter</a> to receive stories like this one in your inbox</em>.\n<div>\n\nSix days before a local runoff election last year in Frisco, a prosperous and growing suburb of Dallas, Brandon Burden paced the stage of KingdomLife Church. The pastor told congregants that demonic spirits were operating through members of the City Council.\n\nGrasping his Bible with both hands, Burden said God was working through his North Texas congregation to take the country back to its Christian roots. He lamented that he lacked jurisdiction over the state Capitol, where he had gone during the 2021 Texas legislative session to lobby for conservative priorities like expanded gun rights and a ban on abortion.\n\n“But you know what I got jurisdiction over this morning is an election coming up on Saturday,” Burden told parishioners. “I got a candidate that God wants to win. I got a mayor that God wants to unseat. God wants to undo. God wants to shift the balance of power in our city. And I have jurisdiction over that this morning.”\n\nWhat Burden said that day in May 2021 was a violation of a long-standing federal law barring churches and nonprofits from directly or indirectly participating in political campaigns, tax law experts told ProPublica and The Texas Tribune. Although the provision was mostly uncontroversial for decades after it passed in 1954, it has become a target for both evangelical churches and former President Donald Trump, who vowed to eliminate it.\n\nBurden’s sermon is among those at 18 churches identified by the news organizations over the past two years that appeared to violate the Johnson Amendment, a measure named after its author, former President Lyndon B. Johnson. Some pastors have gone so far as to paint candidates they oppose as demonic.\n\nAt one point, churches fretted over losing their tax-exempt status for even unintentional missteps. But the IRS has largely abdicated its enforcement responsibilities as churches have become more brazen. In fact, the number of apparent violations found by ProPublica and the Tribune, and confirmed by three nonprofit tax law experts, are greater than the total number of churches the federal agency has investigated for intervening in political campaigns over the past decade, according to records obtained by the news organizations.\n\nIn response to questions, an IRS spokesperson said that the agency “cannot comment on, neither confirm nor deny, investigations in progress, completed in the past nor contemplated.” Asked about enforcement efforts over the past decade, the IRS pointed the news organizations to annual reports that do not contain such information.\n\nNeither Burden nor KingdomLife responded to multiple interview requests or to emailed questions.\n\nTrump’s opposition to the law banning political activity by nonprofits “has given some politically-minded evangelical leaders a sense that the Johnson Amendment just isn’t really an issue anymore, and that they can go ahead and campaign for or against candidates or positions from the pulpit,” said David Brockman, a scholar in religion and public policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.\n\nAmong the violations the newsrooms identified: In January, an Alaska pastor told his congregation that he was voting for a GOP candidate who is aiming to unseat <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/M001153-lisa-murkowski\">Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski</a>, saying the challenger was the “only candidate for Senate that can flat-out preach.” During a May 15 sermon, a pastor in Rocklin, California, asked voters to get behind “a Christian conservative candidate” challenging Gov. Gavin Newsom. And in July, a New Mexico pastor called Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham “beyond evil” and “demonic” for supporting abortion access. He urged congregants to “vote her behind right out of office” and challenged the media to call him out for violating the Johnson Amendment.\n\nAndrew Whitehead, a sociologist at the University of Indiana-Purdue, who studies Christian nationalism, said the ramping up of political activity by churches could further polarize the country. “It creates hurdles for a healthy, functioning, pluralistic democratic society,” he said. “It’s really hard to overcome.”\n\nThe Johnson Amendment does not prohibit churches from inviting political speakers or discussing positions that may seem partisan nor does it restrict voters from making faith-based decisions on who should represent them. But because donations to churches are tax-deductible and because churches don’t have to file financial disclosures with the IRS, without such a rule donors seeking to influence elections could go undetected, said Andrew Seidel, vice president of strategic communications for the advocacy group Americans United for Separation of Church and State.\n\n“If you pair the ability to wade into partisan politics with a total absence of financial oversight and transparency, you’re essentially creating super PACs that are black holes,” Seidel said.\n\nChurches have long balanced the tightrope of political involvement, and blatant violations have previously been rare. In the 1960s, the IRS investigated complaints that some churches abused their tax-exempt status by distributing literature that was hostile to the election of John F. Kennedy, the country’s first Catholic president. And in 2004, the federal agency audited All Saints Episcopal Church in California after a pastor gave an anti-war speech that imagined Jesus talking to presidential candidates George W. Bush and John Kerry. The pastor did not endorse a candidate but criticized the Iraq war.\n\nSome conservative groups have argued that Black churches are more politically active than their white evangelical counterparts but are not as heavily scrutinized. During the 1984 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Rev. Jesse L. Jackson was accused of turning Sunday sermons into campaign rallies and using Black churches to raise funds. In response to allegations of illegal campaigning, Jackson said at the time that strict guidelines were followed and denied violating the law.\n\nWhile some Black churches have crossed the line into political endorsements, the long legacy of political activism in these churches stands in sharp contrast to white evangelical churches, where some pastors argue devout Christians must take control of government positions, said Robert Wuthnow, the former director of the Princeton University Center for the Study of Religion.\n\nWuthnow said long-standing voter outreach efforts inside Black churches, such as Souls to the Polls, which encourages voting on Sundays after church services, largely stay within the boundaries of the law.\n\n“The Black church has been so keenly aware of its marginalized position,” Wuthnow said. “The Black church, historically, was the one place where Black people could mobilize, could organize, could feel that they had some power at the local level. The white evangelical church has power. It’s in office. It’s always had power.”\n\nAt the end of his two-hour sermon that May, Burden asserted that his church had a God-given power to choose lawmakers, and he asked others to join him onstage to “secure the gate over the city.”\n\nBurden and a handful of church members crouched down and held on to a rod, at times speaking in tongues. The pastor said intruders such as the mayor, who was not up for reelection last year but who supported one of the candidates in the race for City Council, would be denied access to the gates of the city.\n\n“Now this is bold, but I’m going to say it because I felt it from the Lord. I felt the Lord say, ‘Revoke the mayor’s keys to this gate,’” Burden said. “No more do you have the key to the city. We revoke your key this morning, Mr. Mayor.\n\n“We shut you out of the place of power,” Burden added. “The place of authority and influence.”\n<h3>Johnson Amendment’s Cold War Roots</h3>\nQuestions about the political involvement of tax-exempt organizations were swirling when Congress ordered an investigation in April 1952 to determine if some foundations were using their money “for un-American and subversive activities.”\n\nLeading the probe was Rep. Gene Cox, a Georgia Democrat who had accused the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations, among others, of helping alleged Communists or Communist fronts. Cox died during the investigation, and the final report cleared the foundations of wrongdoing.\n\nBut a Republican member of the committee argued for additional scrutiny, and in July 1953, Congress established the House Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations. The committee focused heavily on liberal organizations, but it also investigated nonprofits such as the Facts Forum foundation, which was headed by Texas oilman H.L. Hunt, an ardent supporter of then-Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, a Republican who was best known for holding hearings to investigate suspected Communists.\n\nIn July 1954, Johnson, who was then a senator, proposed an amendment to the U.S. tax code that would strip nonprofits of their tax-exempt status for “intervening” in political campaigns. The amendment sailed through Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nJohnson never explained his intent. Opponents of the amendment, <a href=\"https://www.law.ua.edu/pubs/lrarticles/Volume%2061/Issue%205/combest.pdf\">as well as some academics</a>, say Johnson was motivated by a <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2606&amp;context=caselrev\">desire to undercut conservative foundations</a> such as the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government, founded by newspaper magnate Frank Gannett, which painted the Democrat as soft on communism and supported his opponent in the primary election. <a href=\"https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1265&amp;context=caselrev\">Others have hypothesized</a> that Johnson was hoping to head off a wider crackdown on nonprofit foundations.\n\nOver the next 40 years, the IRS stripped a handful of religious nonprofits of their tax-exempt status. None were churches.\n\nThen, just four days before the 1992 presidential election, Branch Ministries in New York ran two full-page ads in USA Today and The Washington Times urging voters to reject then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, in his challenge to Republican President George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe ads proclaimed: “Christian Beware. Do not put the economy ahead of the Ten Commandments.” They asserted that Clinton violated scripture by supporting “abortion on demand,” homosexuality and the distribution of condoms to teenagers in public schools. Clinton, the ads said, was “openly promoting policies that are in rebellion to God’s laws.”\n\nThe IRS revoked the church’s tax-exempt status, leading to a long legal battle that ended with a <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/branch-ministries-v-rossotti\">U.S. appeals court siding with the federal agency</a>.\n\nThe case remains the only publicly known example of the IRS revoking the tax-exempt status of a church because of its political activity in nearly 70 years. The Congressional Research Service said in 2012 that a <a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL34447.html\">second church had </a><a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL34447.html\">lost its tax-exempt status, but that its identity “is not clear.”</a>\n\nCiting an increase in allegations of church political activity leading up to the 2004 presidential election between incumbent Bush and Kerry, IRS officials created the Political Activities Compliance Initiative to <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/paci_procedures_feb_22_2006.pdf\">fast-track investigations</a>.\n\nOver the next four years, the committee investigated <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/2006paci_report_5-30-07.pdf\">scores of churches</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/fy2011_eo_workplan.pdf\">80 for endorsing candidates</a> from the pulpit, according to IRS reports. But it did not revoke the tax-exempt status of any. Instead, the IRS mostly sent warning letters that agency officials said were effective in dissuading churches from continuing their political activity, asserting that there were no repeat offenders in that period.\n\nIn some cases, the IRS initiated audits of churches that could have led to financial penalties. It’s unclear how many did.\n\nIn January 2009, a <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/minnesota/mndce/0:2008mc00037/101893/26/\">federal court dismissed an audit</a>into alleged financial improprieties at a Minnesota church whose pastor had supported the congressional campaign of former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Republican from Minnesota.\n\nThe court found that the IRS had not been following its own rules for a decade because it was tasked with notifying churches of their legal rights before any pending audits and was required to have an appropriately high-level official sign off on them. But a 1998 agency reorganization had eliminated the position, leaving lower IRS employees to initiate church investigations.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the IRS suspended its investigations into church political activity for five years, according to a <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-15-514.pdf\">2015 Government Accountability Office report</a>.\n\nDuring the hiatus, a conservative Christian initiative called Pulpit Freedom Sunday flourished. Pastors recorded themselves endorsing candidates or giving political sermons that they believed violated the Johnson Amendment and sent them to the IRS. The goal, according to participants, was to trigger <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/defiant-pastors-irs-pulpit-freedom-sunday/story?id=11726610\">a lawsuit that would lead to the prohibition being ruled unconstitutional</a> by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe IRS never challenged participating churches, and the effort wound down without achieving its aim.\n\nIn response to a Freedom of Information Act request from ProPublica and the Tribune last year, the IRS produced a severely redacted spreadsheet indicating the agency had launched inquiries into 16 churches since 2011. IRS officials shielded the results of the probes, and they have declined to answer specific questions.\n\nDespite the agency’s limited enforcement, Trump promised shortly after he took office that he would “totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.”\n\nAs president, Trump tried unsuccessfully to remove the restrictions on church politicking through a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/jul/18/donald-trump/trump-claims-he-got-rid-johnson-amendment-true/\">executive order</a>. The move was largely symbolic because it simply ordered the government not to punish churches differently than it would any other nonprofit, according to a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/25/critics-said-trumps-religious-liberty-order-does-nothing-the-administrations-lawyers-seem-to-agree/\">legal filing</a> by the Justice Department.\n\nEliminating the Johnson Amendment would require congressional or judicial action.\n\nAlthough the IRS has not discussed its plans, it has taken procedural steps that would enable it to ramp up audits again if it chooses to.\n\nIn 2019, more than two decades after eliminating the high-level position needed to sign off on action against churches, the IRS designated the commissioner of the agency’s tax-exempt and government entities division as the “appropriate high-level Treasury official” with the power to initiate a church audit.\n\nBut Philip Hackney, a former IRS attorney and University of Pittsburgh tax law professor, said he doesn’t read too much into that. “I don’t see any reason to believe that the operation of the IRS has changed significantly.”\n<h3>The Pulpit and Politics</h3>\nThere is no uniform way to monitor church sermons across the country. But with the COVID-19 pandemic, many churches now post their services online, and ProPublica and the Tribune reviewed dozens of them. Many readers shared sermons with us. (You can do so <a href=\"https://propublica.forms.fm/tell-us-how-religious-organizations-in-your-area-involve-themselves-in-elections\">here</a>.)\n\nTexas’ large evangelical population and history of activism in Black churches makes the state a focal point for debates over political activity, said Matthew Wilson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.\n\n“Combine all of that with the increasing competitiveness of Texas elections, and it’s no surprise that more and more Texas churches are taking on a political role,” he said. “Texas is a perfect arena for widespread, religiously motivated political activism.”\n\nThe state also has a long history of politically minded pastors, Wuthnow said. Texas evangelical church leaders joined the fight in support of alcohol prohibition a century ago and spearheaded efforts to defeat Democrat Al Smith, the first Catholic to be nominated for president by a major party, in 1928. In the 1940s, evangelical fundamentalism began to grow in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nToday, North Texas remains home to influential pastors such as Robert Jeffress, who leads the First Baptist megachurch in Dallas. Jeffress was one of Trump’s most fervent supporters, appearing at campaign events, defending him on television news shows and stating that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/534014-jeffress-says-he-absolutely-does-not-regret-supporting-trump-after/\">he “absolutely” did not regret supporting the former president</a> after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\n\nBurden went a step further, urging followers to stock up on food and keep their guns loaded ahead of President Joe Biden’s inauguration. He told parishioners that “prophetic voices” had told him in 2016 that Trump would have eight consecutive years in office.\n\nThe Frisco Conservative Coalition board <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2021/01/29/frisco-pastors-conservative-pac-loses-board-members-in-the-fallout-from-his-comments-about-trump-guns/\">voted to suspend</a> Burden as chair for 30 days after criticism about his remarks.\n\nBurden called his comments “inartful” but claimed he was unfairly targeted for his views. “The establishment media is coming after me,” he said<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKzTHYatYDI\">at the time</a>. “But it is not just about me. People of faith are under attack in this country.”\n\nSince then, Burden has repeatedly preached that the church has been designated by the Lord to decide who should serve in public office and “take dominion” over Frisco.\n\nAs the runoff for the Frisco City Council approached last year, Burden supported Jennifer White, a local veterinarian. White had positioned herself as the conservative candidate in the nonpartisan race against Angelia Pelham, a Black human resources executive who had the backing of the Frisco mayor.\n\nWhite said she wasn’t in attendance during the May 2021 sermon in which Burden called her the “candidate that God wants to win.” She said she does not believe pastors should endorse candidates from the pulpit, but she welcomed churches becoming more politically active.\n\n“I think that the churches over the years have been a big pretty big disappointment to the candidates in that they won't take a political stance,” White said in an interview. “So I would love it if churches would go ahead and come out and actually discuss things like morality. Not a specific party, but at least make sure people know where the candidates stand on those issues. And how to vote based on that.”\n\nPelham’s husband, local pastor Dono Pelham, also made a statement that violated the Johnson Amendment by “indirectly intervening” in the campaign, said Ellen Aprill, an emerita tax law professor at Loyola Marymount Law School in Los Angeles\n\nIn May 2021, Pelham told his church that the race for a seat on the City Council had resulted in a runoff. He acknowledged that his church’s tax-exempt status prevented him from supporting candidates from the pulpit. Then, he added, “but you’ll get the message.”\n\n“It’s been declared for the two candidates who received the most votes, one of which is my wife,” Pelham said. “That’s just facts. That’s just facts. That’s just facts. And so a runoff is coming and every vote counts. Be sure to vote.”\n\nPelham then asked the congregation: “How did I do? I did all right, didn’t I? You know I wanted to go a little further, but I didn’t do it.”\n\nAngelia Pelham, who co-founded Life-Changing Faith Christian Fellowship in 2008 with her husband, said the couple tried to avoid violating the Johnson Amendment. Both disagreed that her husband’s mention of her candidacy was a violation.\n\n“I think church and state should remain separate,” Angelia Pelham said in an interview, adding: “But I think there’s a lot of folks in the religious setting that just completely didn’t even consider the line. They erased it completely and lost sight of the Johnson Amendment.”\n\nShe declined to discuss Burden’s endorsement of her opponent.\n\nIn his sermon the morning after Pelham defeated his chosen candidate, Burden told parishioners that the church’s political involvement would continue.\n\n“So you’re like, but you lost last night? No, we set the stage for the future,” he said, adding “God is uncovering the demonic structure that is in this region.”\n<h3>“Demonic” Candidate</h3>\nMost Americans don’t want pastors making endorsements from the pulpit, according <a href=\"https://publicconsultation.org/united-states/overwhelming-bi-partisan-majority-opposes-allowing-churches-other-nonprofits-to-engage-in-political-activity/\">to a 2017 survey</a> by the Program for Public Consultation, which is part of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland.\n\nOf the nearly 2,500 registered voters who were surveyed, 79% opposed getting rid of the Johnson Amendment. Only among Republican evangelical voters did a slight majority — 52% — favor loosening restrictions on church political activity.\n\nBut such endorsements are taking place across the country, with some pastors calling for a debate about the Johnson Amendment.\n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, New Mexico became an island of abortion access for women in Texas and other neighboring states.\n\nThe issue raised the stakes in the upcoming Nov. 8 New Mexico governor’s race between incumbent Lujan Grisham, a supporter of abortion rights, and Republican challenger Mark Ronchetti, who advocates limiting access.\n\n“We’re going to fast become the No. 1 abortion place in all of America,” a pastor, Steve Smothermon, said during a July 10 sermon at Legacy Church in Albuquerque, which has an average weekly attendance of more than 10,000 people. Smotherman said the governor was “wicked and evil” and called her “a narcissist.”\n\n“And people think, ‘Why do you say that?’ Because I truly believe it. In fact, she’s beyond evil. It’s demonic,” Smothermon said.\n\nHe later added: “Folks, when are we going to get appalled? When are we going to say, ‘Enough is enough’? When are we going to stop saying, ‘Well, you know, it’s a woman’s right to choose’? That’s such a lie.”\n\nChurch attendees had a stark choice in the upcoming election, Smothermon said. “We have the Wicked Witch of the North. Or you have Mark Ronchetti.”\n\nThe governor’s campaign declined to comment. Neither Legacy Church, Smothermon nor Ronchetti responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe sermon was a “clear violation” of the Johnson Amendment, said Sam Brunson, a Loyola University Chicago law professor. But Smothermon showed no fear of IRS enforcement.\n\nThose who thought he crossed the line were “so stupid,” Smothermon said during the sermon. “You have no idea what you’re talking about.”\n\nIn another example, pastors at a Fort Worth church named Mercy Culture have repeatedly endorsed candidates for local and statewide offices since its founding in 2019.\n\n“Now, obviously, churches don’t endorse candidates, but my name is Landon and I’m a person before I’m a pastor. And as an individual, I endorse Nate Schatzline,” the lead pastor, Landon Schott, said in a February sermon about a church member who was running to fill an open state representative seat.\n\nJohnson Amendment rules allow pastors to endorse in their individual capacity, as long as they are not at an official church function, which Schott was.\n\nIn other services, Schott challenged critics to complain to the IRS about the church’s support of political candidates and said he wasn’t worried about losing the church’s tax-exempt status.\n\n“If you want it that bad, come and take it. And if you think that we will stop preaching the gospel, speaking truth over taxes, you got another thing coming for you,” Schott said in May.\n\nSchatzline, a member of Mercy Culture, received 65% of the vote in a May 24 runoff against the former mayor of the Dallas suburb of Southlake. He works for a separate nonprofit founded by Heather Schott, a pastor at Mercy Culture and the wife of Landon Schott.\n\nSchatzline said in an interview with ProPublica and the Tribune that Landon Schott, not the church, endorsed him. He added that the church sought legal advice on how to ensure that it was complying with the Johnson Amendment.\n\n“I think prayers can manifest into anything that God wants them to, but I would say that the community rallying behind me as individuals definitely manifested into votes,” Schatzline said.\n\nMercy Culture also supported Tim O’Hare, a Republican running for Tarrant County judge, this year after he came out against the shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. His opponent in the primary had ordered churches and businesses to temporarily close when she was mayor of Fort Worth.\n\nO’Hare came to prominence as the mayor of suburban Farmers Branch, where he championed a city ordinance to prohibit landlords from renting to immigrants without legal status. A federal <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2010/03/25/judge-rules-farmers-branch-rental-ban-is-unconstitutional/\">court declared the ordinance unconstitutional</a> in 2010 after a legal battle that cost the city $6.6 million.\n\nO’Hare has pledged to hire an election integrity officer to oversee voting and “uncover election fraud.”\n\n“The Lord spoke to me and said, ‘Begin to pray for righteous judges in our city,’” Heather Schott said during a Feb. 13 service. “I am believing that Mr. Tim O’Hare is an answered prayer of what we have been petitioning heaven for for the last year and a half.”\n\nNeither Mercy Culture, Landon Schott nor Heather Schott responded to requests for comment. O’Hare also did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment.\n\nSchott’s comments were a prohibited endorsement, said Aprill, the emerita tax law professor at Loyola Marymount Law School in Los Angeles.\n\n“It doesn’t say ‘vote for him’ but is still an endorsement,” she said. “There’s no other way to understand the statement that O’Hare has answered prayers for righteous judges.”\n\nTwo weeks later, O’Hare won his primary. He faces Deborah Peoples, a Democrat, on Nov. 8.\n<h3>A New Tactic</h3>\nOn April 18, 2021, a day before early voting began for city council and school board elections across Texas, pastors at churches just miles apart flashed the names of candidates on overhead screens. They told their congregations that local church leaders had gathered to discuss upcoming city and school elections and realized that their members were among those seeking office.\n\n“We’re not endorsing a candidate. We’re not doing that. But we just thought because they’re a member of the family of God, that you might want to know if someone in the family and this family of churches is running,” said Robert Morris, who leads the Gateway megachurch in Southlake and served as a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/trump-evangelical-advisory-board-224612#ixzz4CEyuuiJD\">member of Trump’s evangelical advisory board</a>.\n\nOn the same day, Doug Page gave a similar message less than 5 miles away at First Baptist Grapevine.\n\n“And so what we decided to do is look within our church families and say, ‘Who do we know that’s running for office?’ Now, let me clarify with you. This is not an endorsement by us. We are not endorsing anyone. However, if you’re part of a family, you’d like to know if Uncle Bill is running for office, right? And so that’s all we’re going to do is simply inform you.”\n\nSaying that you are not endorsing a candidate “isn’t like a magic silver bullet that makes it so that you’re not endorsing them,” Brunson said.\n\nThe churches’ coordination on messaging across the area is notable, according to University of Notre Dame tax law professor Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, who said he hadn’t before seen churches organizing to share lists of candidates.\n\n“I do think this strategy is new,” said Mayer, who has studied the Johnson Amendment for more than a decade. “I hadn’t heard of that before. It’s quite a sophisticated tactic.”\n\nEight of the nine candidates mentioned by the pastors won their races.\n\nMindy McClure, who ran for reelection to the Grapevine-Colleyville school board, said she thought church involvement contributed to her defeat in a June 5, 2021, runoff by about 4 percentage points. Her opponent <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ShannonBraunForGCISD/photos/a.142482884556370/153044090166916/\">campaigned on removing critical race theory</a> from district curriculum, while McClure said students “weren’t being indoctrinated in any way, shape or form.” Critical race theory is a college-level academic theory that racism is embedded in legal systems.\n\nMcClure said pastors endorsing from the pulpit creates “divisiveness” in the community.\n\n“Just because you attend a different church doesn’t mean that you’re more connected with God,” she said.\n\nLawrence Swicegood, executive director of Gateway Media, said this month that the church doesn’t endorse candidates but “inform(s) our church family of other church family members who are seeking office to serve our community.” Page told ProPublica and the Tribune that “these candidates were named for information only.”\n\nEleven days after responding to ProPublica and the Tribune in October, Morris once again told his church that he was not endorsing any candidates during the last Sunday sermon before early voting. Then, he again displayed the names of specific candidates on a screen and told parishioners to take screenshots with their cellphones.\n\n“We must vote,” he said. “I think we have figured that out in America, that the Christians sat on the sidelines for too long. And then all of a sudden they started teaching our children some pretty mixed up things in the schools. And we had no one to blame but ourselves. So let’s not let that happen. Especially at midterms.”\n\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://pixel.propublica.org/pixel.js\" async=\"\"></script>\n",

Does the term <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evangelical\" target=\"_blank\">evangelical</a> retain any religious connections to the teaching of the gospel and Christianity today?  Or has it been transformed into a primarily political identity retaining only some of the form and ritual but none of the salvific intent (or power)?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Looking back at the entire aftermath of 9/11 (not just the Trump era, as professional commentators tend to), it seems clear that in practice the word evangelical now functions primarily as a political identity—often in opposition not just to the values of the gospel to which it refers, but to the values of evangelicals who aren’t white. In 2009, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2009/04/29/the-religious-dimensions-of-the-torture-debate/\" target=\"_blank\">a majority of white evangelical Protestants surveyed said torture against terrorism suspects could sometimes or often be justified.</a>  In 2018, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/06/18/why-many-white-evangelical-christians-are-not-protesting-family-separations-on-the-u-s-border/\" target=\"_blank\">75% of white evangelical Christians surveyed rated “the federal crackdown on undocumented immigrants” as positive, compared with 46 percent of U.S. adults overall, and 25 percent of nonwhite Christians.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>McKissic characterizes voting for Democrats as \"anti-family values\".  But it is quite difficult to ignore the hypocrisy of talking about “family values” when government policy under the GOP deliberately separated children from their parents and gave those children to foster families, as this country has done in decades past with Native American children (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-takes-dispute-native-american-adoption-law-rcna17948\" target=\"_blank\">and may soon do again, depending on how the Supreme Court rules in this term</a>).  To bring the question of family values to the present, does it reinforce them or undermine them to support a candidate like Herschel Walker?  He has not only engaged in intimate partner violence against his now-former wife on multiple occasions, but infidelity resulting in children on multiple occasions, paid for one of his girlfriends to have an abortion, and pressured her to have a second abortion (which she refused).  It is very telling that one of Walker’s earliest defenders after these latest revelations was Newt Gingrich, a man whose own infidelities cost him the speakership of the House. The language Dana Loesch chose to degrade the woman Walker paid to have an abortion (and with whom Walker would later had a child) is very telling, as is her complete lack of actual concern re: abortion in favor of prioritizing the power the GOP would have if Walker’s election gave them control of the Senate.  Even today, the deliberate cruelty to asylum seekers by Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas appears to find significant support among white evangelicals, not at all consistent with the words of Exodus 23:9, or Leviticus 19:33-34, or Deuteronomy 24:14, or any other verses regarding the proper treatment of strangers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/07/karen-attiah-newsletter-kanye-west-herschel-walker-toxic/\" target=\"_blank\">Karen Attiah has written quite powerfully about the politics of toxic black men like Herschel Walker</a> (and Kanye West).  The contrast between how white evangelicals regard Walker and their treatment of Barack Obama (and his wife) couldn't be starker.  They celebrate the former and denigrate the latter.  It is necessary and important to question the \"pro-family\" bonafides of those who promote and elevate people who embody some of the worst stereotypes of black men--especially when it comes to how they treat the women in their lives.  During his presidency, I heard more than one white congregant in my own church denomination suggest Obama might be the Antichrist.  To hear any Christian to say such things about any political leader (Obama or otherwise) while making excuses for the likes of Trump--who made deliberate cruelty to asylum seekers official government policy (to say nothing of his consistent and flagrant disregard for numerous tenets of Christian belief) saddens me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A single tweet doesn't allow room for either nuance or more expansive thought, but the most consequential divide between the GOP and the Democrats right now is the insurrection on January 6, 2021 and their responses to it.  It is difficult to imagine actions more contrary to the words of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+2%3A1-4&amp;version=NASB\" target=\"_blank\">1 Timothy 2:1-4</a> re: prayer for our leaders than the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://religionnews.com/2022/06/09/how-christian-nationalism-paved-the-way-for-january-6/\" target=\"_blank\">participation of white evangelicals in violent opposition to the peaceful transfer of power</a> to Biden from Trump.  There is plenty of room to disagree with the policy choices of the Democratic Party.  But rather than win the arguments at the ballot box, many Republicans are on record not only pushing falsehoods about the results of the 2020 presidential election, but continuing to strive for the power to overturn whatever popular will voters express in November 2022 and in elections to come.  Having succeeded in using the courts to diminish the power of black voters, the GOP now seeks to invalidate any and all elections that don't go their way.  True religious freedom--not just for Christians, but for those of other faiths (or no faith)--will not survive in a country where a party that doesn't win at the ballot box can simply ignore the result and stay in power.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"title": "Waiter, there's a [brown person] in my [fictional world]",
				"content_html": "<p>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power finally debuted on Amazon Prime, and right on cue came the complaints from white fans of Lord of the Rings about &ldquo;wokeness&rdquo;.  What seems new about this latest iteration of the &ldquo;waiter, there&rsquo;s a [brown person] in my [fictional world]&rdquo; phenomenon is the deliberate decision of the mainstream media to legitimize these complaints about said fictional world.  The tweet below is a great summation of the journalist malpractice being engaged in here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/carnage4life/status/1566399200329605120?s=21&amp;t=6I08T9JZouMjVoGJdCEj9Q\">twitter.com/carnage4l&hellip;</a></p>\n<p>When you lead off a piece with complaints about a fictional world with the deputy managing editor of redstate.com, that&rsquo;s bad enough.  But it&rsquo;s even worse when you conflate fans of Tolkien with actual scholars.  Running a story like this&ndash;which elevates the weakest of arguments from people with thin credentials at best&ndash;seems to be a preview of what we can expect from the new, &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; CNN.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve written only briefly about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars being my earliest fandom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  But nearly as old as my Star Wars fandom is my love of The Lord of the Rings.  I came to it first through watching the Rankin/Bass version of The Hobbit in the early 80s, then the books.  The Lord of the Rings definitely contributed to my becoming a D&amp;D player later on (and a reader of many other books in the fantasy genre).  In college, I took the comparative mythology class taught by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dr. Verlyn Flieger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (a well-known Tolkien scholar) because it gave me an excuse to read The Silmarillion for credit instead of just for fun.  It&rsquo;s been nearly 30 years since I took her course, but I still remember it because to her credit she gave us what would later be called a trigger warning regarding the depictions of Gollum in Tolkien&rsquo;s work (which wasn&rsquo;t perceived as racist by many people then, but likely would be now).  I don&rsquo;t recall if she gave us a similar warning regarding the descriptions of orcs, but it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if she did.  N.K.

One way to look at Biden's plan is it releases a lot of highly educated people to do more risk taking things like open businesses and more altruistic things like work for non-profits. It's not just good for those people but possibly everybody else in society.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This comment gets at the heart of a very particular way in which too many of today's political leaders fall short when compared to their predecessors.  Instead of elected officials (particularly those in the GOP) using their positions to govern in a way that benefits as many people in their particular sphere of responsibility as possible, many choose instead to validate and amplify a false individualism.  They deliberately heighten the \"us vs them\" dynamic that already exists in the country to retain their own power, defining more and more Americans (those eligible for student loan forgiveness in this case) as an unworthy \"them\".  However imperfect Biden's debt forgiveness plan is, it at least attempts to do something for the benefit of a broad set of Americans who can use the help.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

As has been written far more eloquently by Adam Serwer among others, it seems that <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/alito-leaked-roe-opinion-abortion-supreme-court-civil-rights/629748/\" target=\"_blank\">the 19th century is the era to which Alito would have us return</a>.

Whether traveling for freedom from enslavement or to a state where abortion remains legal, it is quite disturbing to be able to draw any parallel between a woman's legal status in 1851 and her status in 2022.  It simply should not be the case that my daughter should grow up in a modern democracy with fewer rights than my wife did when it comes to her body.

The unwillingness of some of my fellow believers to be part of slowing and stopping a pandemic that killed 1 million of our fellow Americans and over 6 million worldwide has been a frankly depressing thing to see.  Regular church attendance has been part of my life for decades, the point of origin of many of my longest lasting friendships, and where I met my wife.  Church had been a regular part of our children's lives as well until the pandemic hit, and for the better part of two years we've forgone in-person church attendance in hopes of helping bring the pandemic to an end.  Looking to the interests of others instead of ourselves is just one of many lessons of Philippians 2 that the American church has not done a good job of exemplifying of late.   </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The willingness of my fellow Christians to abuse the power of the state and the judiciary to impose their particular interpretation of the Bible on those who don't share that interpretation (or share their faith at all) does not merely bode ill for both the church and the state, but is contrary to the free will we believe God grants to accept or reject salvation.  Having seen not just the Supreme Court, but conservative politicians so blithely dismiss the rights of those who do not share their beliefs or worldview, it is not difficult to imagine a future that is as bad as our past when it comes to religious pluralism.  My own home state of Maryland, originally intended as a refuge for Catholics (though few actual Catholics were part of its founding), ultimately brought up the rear in this respect for the entire country at the time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1667,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.genxjamerican.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_1327-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1667\"><figcaption>An exhibit from the Weitzman National Museum of American Jewish History</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Declaration of Independence may be 246 years old soon, but <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/multiracial-democracy-55-years-old-will-it-survive/617585/\" target=\"_blank\">true democracy in this country is much younger</a>.

Included in his argument however, are skepticism of some of the claims of hurt by students hearing the word used.  Further, he argues that his race should not give him more leeway to use the n-word than his white colleagues.  Dr. John McWhorter, a professor of linguistics, has <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/opinion/john-mcwhorter-n-word-unsayable.html\" target=\"_blank\">written about the n-word</a> on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/whites-refer-to-the-n-word/596872/\" target=\"_blank\">multiple occasions</a> prior to the controversy over Rogan's usage of it.  Beyond pedagogy (in use) or virtue-signaling (in non-use), the question not being asked or adequately answered is why this debate only seems to persist around the use of a slur that only applies to black people (though there is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sand%20niggers\" target=\"_blank\">a modifier for it that applies to Middle Eastern people</a> that I first heard in the movie <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://clip.cafe/the-siege-1998/tell-them-im-not-their-sand-nigger-anymore/\" target=\"_blank\">The Siege</a>)?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This quote by James Baldwin poses and answers that question more eloquently and bluntly:<br>“What white people have to do is try and find out in their own hearts why it is necessary to have a 'nigger' in the first place, because I'm not a nigger. I'm a man. But if you think I'm a nigger, it means you need it.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A poem written in 1912 and attributed to H.P. Lovecraft, provides another answer to where the necessity for the word (and the idea) comes from:<br>\"When, long ago, the gods created Earth<br>In Jove's fair image Man was shap'd at birth.<br>The beasts for lesser parts were next design'd;<br>Yet were they too remote from humankind.<br>To fill the gap, and join the rest to man,<br>Th'Olympian host conceiv'd a clever plan.<br>A beast they wrought, in semi-human figure,<br>Fill'd it with vice, and call'd the thing a NIGGER.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-SEB-84058\" target=\"_blank\">In Lovecraft's conception</a> (and almost certainly in the conception of others who subscribed to the eugenics movement as he did), black people were not fully human.  We were beasts to be feared, objects of and/or causes of lust, purveyors of vices, corrupters of innocence--but not human beings like everyone else.  While Lovecraft is long since dead, the sentiments behind his poetically-expressed contempt for black folks live on in others--not just in the body politic, but in some of its leaders as well.  This is why <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://floridapolitics.com/archives/495255-ron-desantis-says-joe-rogan-owes-no-apologies-amid-n-word-scandal/\" target=\"_blank\">the governor of an entire state can say publicly that Joe Rogan should not have apologized</a> (for using the n-word).  I believe this to be at the heart of why the debate over the word continues.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To borrow from James Baldwin again, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YPaBXcEVpOE?t=227\">he expresses the sentiment well regarding how American society in his time used</a> and viewed black people:<br>\"That in a way black men were very useful for the American.  Because, in a country so absolutely undefined - so amorphous - where there were no limits - no height really and no depth - there was one thing of which one could be certain.  One knew where one was, by knowing where the Negro was.  You knew that you were not on the bottom because the Negro was there.\"<br>Though decades have passed since Baldwin spoke these words, it seems that America has yet to outgrow its need for black people to define where the bottom of society is, and the casual (if not unapologetic) usage of the n-word is just one manifestation of that broader sentiment.  I maintain no illusions that this affliction is unique to the political right, or to libertarian ideology.  Those on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://twitter.com/MsMelChen/status/1490032451372023809?s=20&amp;t=OPb1eTwu5bgxZ4emoXBt_Q\" target=\"_blank\">the political left are no shrinking violets when it comes to using \"the hard r\"</a>.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is very telling that many of the same people who rush to defend voices of dissent in other contexts lack the same concern when it comes to black people objecting to the use of a slur targeting them.  The social norms  against using slurs and stereotypes which attack Jews, or Italians, or the Irish, or Hispanics, or Asian people remain intact.  You rarely (if ever) see people from those communities presuming to give out metaphorical hall passes for others to use slurs against them without consequences.  Because black people are still not seen or treated as full citizens of this country, our opinions on \"the contours of acceptable speech\" lack the same weight as those of others.  Too many people in this country apparently still prefer an older version of it where slurs against black people could be said without consequence.  But that isn't a version of America we're returning to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_html": "<p>The third Monday in January is here, and once again people who oppose everything Dr. King stood for are abusing the one line they know from the I Have a Dream Speech (because they don&rsquo;t know any others) for their own political ends.  This annual whitewashing of King&rsquo;s legacy only succeeds to the degree it has because the people doing the whitewashing don&rsquo;t dare venture beyond the confines of that line in that speech because too much of what he written stands in direct opposition to their political aims.  This applies not just to the secular, but to the religious as well.</p>\n<p>One of my cousins read his children <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Letter from Birmingham Jail<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday.  This letter is where we can find the phrase &ldquo;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&rdquo;    This letter is also where we can find this phrase: &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  You can be certain that none of the hypocrites quoting King today will quote that.  Decades after this letter was written, we&rsquo;ve seen how this country continues to treat and talk about certain immigrants.  Decades after this letter was written, the segregation and police brutality of which King wrote in 1963 are still problems in this country today.  Actually reading his letter reveals that direct action was chosen as a last resort, only after the local leaders they negotiated with broke their promises.</p>\n<p>This passage from the letter is sadly relevant once again in the wake of GOP measures to make it harder for those in the electorate who oppose their program to cast votes:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>An unjust law is a code inflicted upon a minority which that minority had no part in enacting or creating because it did not have the unhampered right to vote. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up the segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout the state of Alabama all types of conniving methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties without a single Negro registered to vote, despite the fact that the Negroes constitute a majority of the population. Can any law set up in such a state be considered democratically structured?</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>When you read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the letter written by eight Alabama clergyman that King was responding to, the motivation for this paragraph becomes crystal-clear:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&rsquo;s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, &ldquo;I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can&rsquo;t agree with your methods of direct action&rdquo;; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man&rsquo;s freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a &ldquo;more convenient season.&rdquo; Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>King&rsquo;s decades-old criticism of the contemporary Christian church in the America of his day should shame today&rsquo;s Christian church:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The contemporary church is so often a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. It is so often the arch supporter of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the church&rsquo;s often vocal sanction of things as they are.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before.

				"content_text": "The third Monday in January is here, and once again people who oppose everything Dr. King stood for are abusing the one line they know from the I Have a Dream Speech (because they don't know any others) for their own political ends.  This annual whitewashing of King's legacy only succeeds to the degree it has because the people doing the whitewashing don't dare venture beyond the confines of that line in that speech because too much of what he written stands in direct opposition to their political aims.  This applies not just to the secular, but to the religious as well.\n\nOne of my cousins read his children <a href=\"https://www.csuchico.edu/iege/_assets/documents/susi-letter-from-birmingham-jail.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Letter from Birmingham Jail</a> yesterday.  This letter is where we can find the phrase \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\"    This letter is also where we can find this phrase: \"<strong>Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider</strong>\".  You can be certain that none of the hypocrites quoting King today will quote that.  Decades after this letter was written, we've seen how this country continues to treat and talk about certain immigrants.  Decades after this letter was written, the segregation and police brutality of which King wrote in 1963 are still problems in this country today.  Actually reading his letter reveals that direct action was chosen as a last resort, only after the local leaders they negotiated with broke their promises.\n\nThis passage from the letter is sadly relevant once again in the wake of GOP measures to make it harder for those in the electorate who oppose their program to cast votes:\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n\nAn unjust law is a code inflicted upon a minority which that minority had no part in enacting or creating because it did not have the unhampered right to vote. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up the segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout the state of Alabama all types of conniving methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties without a single Negro registered to vote, despite the fact that the Negroes constitute a majority of the population. Can any law set up in such a state be considered democratically structured?\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n\nWhen you read <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/sites/mlk/files/lesson-activities/clergybirmingham1963.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the letter written by eight Alabama clergyman that King was responding to, the motivation for this paragraph becomes crystal-clear:</a>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n\nFirst, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a \"more convenient season.\" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\nOne key insight among many in King's five-and-a-half page letter is the different ways in which the black community responded to the stubborn persistence of Jim Crow &amp; segregation: adjusting to it, being desensitized to the problems of those black less secure economically and academically than themselves, or bitterness.   His warnings about what could happen if the nonviolent efforts for justice he supported were rejected would unfortunately become true--not just in the immediate wake of his assassination five years after this letter, but many times in the wake of police violence resulting in the death of someone in their custody (and/or acquittals as the result of the rare court trials officers faced for such violence).\n\nKing's decades-old criticism of the contemporary Christian church in the America of his day should shame today's Christian church:\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n\nThe contemporary church is so often a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. It is so often the arch supporter of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the church's often vocal sanction of things as they are.\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n\nBut the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If the church of today does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its authentic ring, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. I meet young people every day whose disappointment with the church has risen to outright disgust.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\nThe hypocrites referencing King on this day are doing things like invoking his name in support of \"All Lives Matter\", or to support their bans on Critical Race Theory (which could pretty easily prevent children in our public schools from actually learning anything about King's letter).  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/30ui1x-eKIw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Some More News has a hilarious, profane, and correct take on the annual whitewashing of King's legacy</a>.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Bush's administration engaged in warrantless surveillance of millions of Americans, extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects, and torture of those same suspects.  Enemy combatant status was created out of thin air, as were the military tribunals in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba--all to deny people the rights they should have had under our Constitution.  The <a href=\"https://bridge.georgetown.edu/research/factsheet-the-nypd-muslim-surveillance-and-mapping-program/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NYPD illegally surveilled Muslims both inside and outside New York City for over a decade</a> after the attacks.  The LAPD tried and failed to create a similar surveillance program in 2007.\n\nThomas Homer-Dixon's piece mentions Christians just twice, once as fertile soil for the seeds of white nationalist great replacement theory to take root and flourish, and again as a group that would be super-empowered in a second Trump administration.  He projects a rise in violence by vigilante, paramilitary groups in the same sentence, though the use of Christian symbols and rhetoric by such groups has a history stretching back well over a century in the US.  The involvement of conservative Christian groups in the insurrection is much less-surprising however when you look back at their response to 9/11.  When surveyed in 2009 by the Pew Research Center, <a href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/2009/04/29/the-religious-dimensions-of-the-torture-debate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a majority of white evangelical Protestants said that torture against terrorism suspects could <strong>sometimes</strong> or <strong>often</strong> be justified</a>.  This belief was held both by majorities of Christians who attended church a few times a year or monthly, and those who attended church weekly--or more often.  Years after the original survey, you could even find a piece like <a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2014/12/17/yes-christians-can-support-torture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this one in The Federalist</a> quoting Bible passages and Thomas Aquinas to argue that Christians <strong>can </strong>support torture.\n\nNot mentioned at all in the Homer-Dixon piece--significant increases in anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.  The first murder victim of an anti-Muslim hate crime turned out to be a naturalized American citizen, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Balbir_Singh_Sodhi#:~:text=Balbir%20Singh%20Sodhi%20(1949%20%E2%80%93%20September,of%20the%20September%2011%20attacks.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Balbir Singh Sodhi</a>.

				"content_text": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"dropCap\":true} --></p>\n<p>Public discourse has turned (again) to the question of whether or not a college degree is \"worth it\". I say again because in the tech industry, this question has been asked about computer science (CS) degrees over a decade ago. I was prompted to revisit <a href=\"https://www.genxjamerican.com/2007/05/17/hackers-and-fighters/\">this blog post</a> from over 14(!) years ago by Scott Hanselman's response to a TikTok video saying a computer science degree is never worth it:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"dropCap\":true} --></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<blockquote data-partner=\"tweetdeck\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Is it worth getting a bachelors in computer science? Let’s just say that making massive declarative statements is very rarely a good idea. <a href=\"https://t.co/qwmabnYCth\">https://t.co/qwmabnYCth</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hmzvFa4bq3\">pic.twitter.com/hmzvFa4bq3</a></p>— Scott Hanselman (@shanselman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1425966139251642369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 12, 2021</a>\n</blockquote>\n\t\t<p>Back in 2007, I was managing a team which consisted mostly of what Tarver calls \"street programmers\".   In that particular experience, Tarver was wrong about street programmers being superior to formally-trained CS graduates.  The members of my staff who consistently turned out the highest-quality code (which not coincidentally was also the best-tested and the least likely to require re-work) all had CS degrees.  In my next role, one of my colleagues was an Air Force veteran who was self-taught in software engineering.  He was one of the most skilled engineers I've worked with in my entire career, and taught me a ton about the practice of continuous integration over a decade ago that I still use in my work today.  </p>\n<p>In re-reading Tarver's post, even he concedes that the combination of hands-on programming practice and a strong grasp of theory creates a superior programmer when compared to one trained only in university or only on-the-job.  The other thing which struck me as odd in retrospect was the lack of any mention of summer internships.  Back in the early-to-mid 90s when I was earning my own computer science degree, it was definitely the expectation that CS majors would complete at least one summer internship before they graduated so they had at least a little experience with programming outside of coursework requirements.  I found an on-campus job where I worked during the semester which at least had tasks that I could automate with scripts, as well as database work.  My summer internship with The Washington Post as a tech intern turned into a part-time job my last semester of undergrad and a full-time job offer at the end of the year.  So instead of a declarative statement such as \"college is never worth it\" or \"college is always worth it\", a better answer to the question is more like \"it depends\".</p><p>Quite a lot has changed since 2007 when it comes to the variety of ways available to learn about programming.  There are lots of programmer bootcamps now.  My current employer partners with one to train college graduates with degrees in fields other than computer science for entry-level software engineering roles with us.  Beyond instructor-led bootcamps, there are a wealth of online education options both free and paid.  Having worked with engineers who came into the field via the bootcamp route at two different companies now, I've seen enough inconsistency in the readiness of bootcamp graduates for professional work that most require more oversight and supervision at entry-level positions than graduates from computer science programs.</p>\n<p>At least some of the discussion about the worth of college degrees (in CS or many other fields) is a function of tuition continuing to increase at rates triple that of inflation (and have been doing so for decades).  The total amount my parents spent on in-state tuition for my CS degree in the 90s might not even cover 2 years at the same school today.  A year of tuition at my 1st-choice school today, Carnegie-Mellon University costs at least triple the $24,000 they charged in 1992.  It might be possible to rationalize paying high tuition for a STEM degree with high long-term earning potential, but those high tuition rates apply regardless of major.</p>\n<p>Another issue that discussions of whether or not college degrees are \"worth it\" consistently misses is how open different fields and companies within those fields are to hiring people without formal training.  Particularly in tech, that openness exists for white men in a way that it definitely does not for people of color.   Shawn Wildermuth's documentary <a href=\"https://helloworldfilm.com\">Hello World</a> gets deep into why women and minorities tend not to pursue careers in software development and even with the credential of a college degree and experience, it can be very challenging to sustain a tech career--much less advance--if you don't look like the people who make hiring and promotion decisions.</p><p>Count me in the camp of those who believe a CS degree is worth it.  I wouldn't have the tech career I have today without it.</p>\n",

After the war, Chinese kids were allowed to attend white public schools, so that was the year that I started first grade.”</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/03/31/isaac-woodard-truman-integration-military/\">Issac Woodard</a> was just one of many black veterans of WWII who was attacked just for wearing his uniform around this time.  <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/03/31/isaac-woodard-truman-integration-military/\">Some black veterans fared even worse than Woodard</a>.  The US military didn't desegregate until 1948.  Over two decades would pass before <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2021/02/12/legacy-of-school-segregation-in-yalobusha-county-black-history-month/\">schools in Yalobusha County, Mississippi (and the rest of the state) would finally desegregate</a>.  At the same time members of the Asian-American &amp; Pacific Islander (AAPI) community were attending better-quality schools and building wealth, many black military veterans were being denied the benefits of the GI Bill.  Black people resorted to <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/5/30/18644165/chicago-redlining-racism-real-estate-contract-rent-mortgages-black-homeownership-racial-wealth-gap\">overpaying for housing via contracts</a>, due to racist real estate covenants and redlining by the Federal Housing Administration.  All of this happened before you even get to the ways in which federal civil rights, voting rights, and fair housing legislation have been actively undermined or passively neglected from the Nixon administration forward.\n\nWhen your experience (and your parents' experience) of the United States doesn’t include the combination of chattel slavery, pogroms, property theft, terrorism, segregation, and other aspects of the black American experience, you’re bound to see this country differently.

				"content_text": "<div>On April 28, I participated in <a href=\"https://www.thecontrabandwagon.com/event/speaker-series-event-the-intersection-of-race-and-technology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a panel and Q &amp; A on the intersection of race &amp; technology</a>.  My 2 co-panelists and I each had 15 minutes for a monologue regarding our personal experiences with how race and the tech industry intersect.  This post will excerpt my prepared remarks.</div>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Excerpt of Prepared Remarks</h3>\n<div>How did I end up writing software for a living anyway?  I blame LEGOs, science fiction, and video games.  While I’ve never actually worked in the gaming industry, I’ve built software solutions for many others—newspapers, radio, e-commerce, government, healthcare, and finance. Tech industry salaries, stocks, and stock options have given me a lifestyle that could accurately be called  upper middle-class, including home ownership and annual domestic and international travel for work and pleasure (at least before the pandemic).</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>For all the financial rewards the industry has had to offer though, \"writing software while black\" has meant being comfortable with being the only one (or one of two) for the majority of my career--going all the way to my initial entry to the field.  As an undergraduate computer science (CS) major at the University of Maryland in the early to mid-nineties, I was on a first-name basis with all the other black CS majors in the department because there were never more than 10-12 of us in the entire department during my 4 1/2 years there--on a campus with tens of thousands of students.  In that time, I only ever knew of one black graduate student in CS.  My instructor in discrete structures at the time was Hispanic.  Even at a school as large as the University of Maryland, when I graduated in the winter of 1996, I was the only black graduate from the computer science department.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Unlike law, medicine, engineering, or  architecture, computer science is still a young enough field that the organizations which have grown up around it to support and affirm practitioners of color are much younger.  The National Society of Black Engineers for example, was formed in 1975.  The Information Technology Senior Management Forum (<a href=\"https://itsmfonline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ITSMF</a>), an organization with the goal of increasing black representation at senior levels in tech management, was formed in 1996.  The oldest founding year I could find for any of the existing tech organizations specifically supporting black coders (Black Girls Code) was 2011.  I’d already been a tech industry professional for 15 years at that point, and in every organization I’d worked for up to that point, I was either the only black software engineer on staff, or 1 of 2.  It would be another 2 years before I would join a company where there was more than one other black person on-staff in a software development role.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I’ve had project and/or people leadership responsibilities for 8-9 years of my over 20 years in tech.  As challenging as succeeding as an under-represented minority in tech has been, adding leadership responsibilities increased the scope of the challenge even more.  As rarely as I saw other black coders, black team leads were even scarcer until I joined my current company in 2017.  It basically took my entire career to find, but it is the only place I've ever worked where being black in tech is normal.  We regularly recruit from HBCUs.  We hire and promote black professionals in technical, analytical, managerial, and executive roles in tech.  There are multiple black women and women at the VP level here.  The diversity even extends to the board of directors--four of its members are black men, including the CEO of F5 Networks.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Perhaps most importantly--and contrary to the sorts of things we hear too often from people like James Damore and others about diversity requiring lower standards--this diverse workforce has helped build and maintain a high performance culture.  This publicly-traded company is regularly in the top 25 of Fortune Magazine's annual best places to work rankings.  But this year--even in the midst of the pandemic--it jumped into the top 10 for the first time.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The company uses its size to the benefit of under-represented minorities in tech with business resource groups.  Two of the BRGs I belong to have provided numerous opportunities to network with other black associates, to recruit and be recruited for growth opportunities in other lines of business.  As a result, it's the only company I've worked for in my entire career where I've had the ability to recruit black engineers to join my team.  These groups have even provided a safe space to vent and grieve regarding the deaths of unarmed black men and women at the hands of police officers.  When we learned that Ahmaud Arbery had been murdered, I had black coworkers I could talk about it with--all the up to the VP level down to the individual contributor level.  We were able to talk about George Floyd's murder at the time, and in the aftermath of Derek Chauvin's trial.  As long as these deaths have been happening, this is the only employer I've ever worked for where I know there is a like-minded community where I can talk through such issues with--as well as sympathetic allies.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Not only has this company put millions of dollars into organizations like the Equal Justice Initiative, they set up a virtual event for EJI's founder, Bryan Stevenson,  to speak to us and field our questions.  Ijeoma Oluo and Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr have participated in corporate events as well.  They are one of just three Palladium Partners with ITSMF.  I recently completed a program they created for us called the Leaders of Color Workshop for the purpose of helping black managers advance within the organization.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>All the good things I've shared doesn't mean it's a perfect employer (as if such a thing existed).  I found it necessary to transfer to a different department and line of business in order to find a manager interested in helping me advance my career.  Talking to my classmates in the most recent workshop revealed quite a few stories of far more negative experiences than mine from people who have been part of company much longer than I have.   They've had at least a couple of instances of viral Medium posts from former employees whose experiences were far more negative than mine.  But at least in my experience, it's been and continues to be a great place to be black in tech.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Because the majority of our workforce is women, and nearly 1/3rd of the staff comes from minority groups that are under-represented in tech, the company has done a pretty good job of avoiding the sort of missteps that can put you in the news for wrong reasons.  Seemingly just in time for the discussion we're about to have, the founders of Basecamp (the very opinionated makers of the product of the same name and the HEY email client among other products) are taking their turns as the proverbial fish in a barrel due to their decision to follow the example of Coinbase in disallowing discussions of politics and social causes at work.  So it was very interesting to read the <a href=\"https://janeyang.org/2021/04/27/an-open-letter-to-jason-and-david/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">open letter published to them by Jane Yang</a>, one of their employees currently on medical leave.  She writes in some detail about the founders' decision to exclude hate speech and harassment from the initial use restrictions policy for their products.  Read <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jason Fried's initial post</a> and <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David Hanson's follow-up</a> for fuller context.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Basecamp is a small example (just 60 employees), Coinbase a slightly larger one (1200+ employees), but they are good proxies both for many companies I've worked for and companies orders of magnitude larger like Facebook, Amazon, and Google who have recently been in the news for discriminatory treatment of underrepresented minorities in their workforce.  Their failures, and those of the tech industry at large to seriously address the lack of diversity in their recruiting and hiring practices has resulted and will continue to result in the creation of products that not only fail to adequately serve under-represented minorities, but actively cause harm.  In the same way monoculture in farming creates genetically uniform crops that are less-resistant to disease and pests, monoculture in corporate environments leads to group think, to more uniform, less-innovative products with a higher risk of automating and perpetuating existing biases.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I recently watched <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/coded-bias/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coded Bias</a>, a documentary available on <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81328723?s=a&amp;trkid=13747225&amp;t=cp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Netflix</a> (and PBS) that highlighted the failings of existing facial recognition technology and the dangers it poses--to people of color in particular (because it tends to be far more inaccurate with darker-skinned people) but to people in general.  Were it not for the work of Joy Buolamwini, a black woman research assistant in computer science at MIT, we might not have learned about these flaws until much later--if at all.  These dangers extend beyond facial recognition technology to the application of algorithms and machine learning to everything from sentencing and parole determinations, hiring and firing decisions, to mortgage, loan, and other credit decisions.  Particularly as a bank employee, I'm much more conscious of the impact that my work and that of my team could potentially have on the lives of black and brown bank customers.  Even though it's outside the scope of my current team's usual work, I've begun making efforts to learn more about the ML and artificial intelligence spaces, and to raise concerns with my senior leadership whenever our use of ML and AI is a topic of discussion.  Despite all the challenges we face being in tech as under-represented minorities, or women, or both, it is vital that more of us get in and stay in tech--and continue to raise the concerns that would otherwise be ignored by today's tech leaders.  Current and future tech products are quite likely to be worse if we don't.</div>\n<div></div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Even before yesterday’s inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the new President and Vice President of the United States, there were calls for unity—even <a href=\"https://www.genxjamerican.com/2020/11/08/empathy-now/\">empathy</a>—and not just from Joe Biden.  Such calls seemed very premature at the time, given the efforts of Trump and his allies to overturn the election result.  With the failure of those efforts, despite a literal assault on the entire legislative branch incited by Trump resulting in five dead, such calls for unity and healing look even more naive.</p>\n<p>Too many so-called conservatives (and some of those further left on the political spectrum) would rather put unity ahead of accountability. MAGA adherents and believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory essentially invaded the  US Capitol and delayed the legislative branch from executing its responsibility to certify the Electoral College results at the urging of the president and his allies. They may have been aided and abetted in this insurrectionist act by multiple members of the GOP in both the Senate and the House. At least one shared the location of Speaker Pelosi on Twitter, as if to direct insurrectionists to her location.  The wife of a Supreme Court justice may have funded the transportation to the Capitol for some of these insurrections.  Even the death toll, the damage to the US Capitol, and the risk to their own lives did not prevent some Republicans from voting against certification of the Electoral College tally once the Capitol was secured.</p>\n<p>Placing unity before accountability too many times before is what has led the country here. Unity before accountability killed Reconstruction, subjecting black Americans to almost another century of domestic terrorism, property theft, and subjugation at the hands of whites. The Nixon pardon, the Iran/Contra pardons, and the lack of accountability for those who engaged in torture and warrant less wiretapping of US citizens all placed unity before accountability.  All of these actions paved the way for President Trump to be acquitted despite clear evidence that he tried to shake down the president of Ukraine in exchange for the announcement of an investigation into Hunter Biden.</p>\n<p>Less than a year has elapsed between the Senate's acquittal of Trump on two impeachment charges and the insurrection on January 6.  Only a tiny number of GOP House members put their country ahead of their party in voting for a second impeachment.  A second acquittal for Trump seems likely--and we will live to regret it.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"title": "The Minimum Wage Debate is Too Narrow and Small",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Recently I've found myself having variations of the same conversation on social media regarding the minimum wage.  Those to my political left have made statements such as \"if your business would fail if you paid workers $15/hour you're exploiting them.\"  Those to my political right--some current or former business owners, some not--argue that minimum wage increases had a definite impact on their bottom line.</p>\n<p>I have two problems with the first argument: (1) it oversimplifies and trivializes a very serious issue, (2) these days, the arguers tend to aim it at small business owners.  Worker exploitation is real, and conflating every employer who follows the law when it comes to pay and other facets of employment harms the cause of combatting serious harms.  The outgoing Trump administration has been trying to <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/trump-administration-reportedly-looking-to-cut-the-already-low-wages-of-h-2a-migrant-farmworkers-while-giving-their-bosses-a-multibillion-dollar-bailout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduce the wages of H-2A workers</a>.  Undocumented workers in sectors like agriculture, food, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/09/home-health-aides-low-wages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home-based healthcare</a>, and others fare even worse.  In some cases, <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/american-rehab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drug addiction treatment has turned thousands of people into little more than indentured servants</a>, with complicity from judges and state regulators.  Until recently, large corporations like Wal-Mart and Amazon evaded accountability for low worker pay and mistreatment despite <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-walmart-mcdonalds-food-stamps-medicaid-minimum-wage-2020-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">having significant percentages of workers on food stamps and Medicaid</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/11/amazon-warehouse-reports-show-worker-injuries/602530/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high rate of worker injuries</a>.</p>\n<p>Another variation of the first argument takes a starting point in the past (like the 1960s) then says the minimum wage should be whatever the rate of inflation would have grown it to be between then and today.  If you go back to when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was alive (for example), the minimum wage today \"should\" be $22/hour.  You can pick any point in time and say what the minimum wage should be based on inflation, but that's not the same as grappling honestly with how industries have changed and/or how the nature of work has changed in the half-century plus since the civil rights era.</p>\n<p>One challenge with the second argument is that the examples cited are typically restaurants or food services--businesses that operate at low margins and have high fixed costs in addition to being labor-intensive.  Even in that sector, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/02/seattle-passed-a-15-minimum-wage-law-in-2014-heres-how-its-turned-out-so-far.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the impacts of a $15/hour minimum wage</a> are not necessarily what you might expect.  But not every business is the restaurant business, and a single sector cannot govern the parameters of debate for an issue that impacts the entire economy and the broader society get a broadly beneficial result.</p>\n<p>At this point in the discussion, someone usually brings up automation, followed by someone mentioning universal basic income (UBI).  What I have said in the past, and will continue to say, is that <strong>automation is coming regardless</strong> of what the federal government, states, and/or localities do with the minimum wage.  As someone who has written software for a living for over 20 years, the essence of my line of work is automating things.  Sometimes software augments what people do by taking over rote or repetitive aspects of their jobs and freeing them up to do more value-added work.  But if an entire job is rote or repetitive, software can and does eliminate jobs.  The combination of software and robots are what enable some manufacturers to produce so many goods without the large number of workers they would have needed in the past.</p>\n<p>Talking about UBI enlarges the conversation, but even then may not fully take on the nature of the relationship between government, business, and people.  We do not talk nearly often enough about how long the United States got by with a much less-robust social safety net than other countries because of how much responsibility employers used to take on for their employees.  Nor do we talk about the amount of additional control that gives employers over their employees--or the cracks in the system that can result from unemployment.  The usual response from the political right whenever there is any discussion of separating health care from employment is to cry \"socialism\".  But the falseness of such charges can be easily exposed.  Capitalism seems to be alive and well in South Korea, and they have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_South_Korea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">universal healthcare system</a>--a significant portion of which is privately funded.  Germany is another country where capitalism, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Germany\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">universal healthcare</a>, and private insurers seem to be co-existing just fine.</p>\n<p>The conversation we need to have, as companies and their shareholders get richer, share fewer of those gains with their workers, and otherwise delegate responsibilities they used to keep as part of the social contract, is how the relationship between government, business, and people should change to reflect the current reality.  The rationale always given for taxing capital gains at a lower rate than wages was investment.  But as we've seen both in the pandemic, and in the corporate response to the big tax cut in 2017, corporate execs mostly pocketed the gains for themselves or did stock buybacks to further inflate their per-share prices.  Far from sharing any of the gains with workers, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/at-t-got-a-giant-tax-cut-but-has-laid-off-thousands-union-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some corporations laid off workers instead</a>.  Given ample evidence that preferential tax treatment for capital gains does not result in more investment, the preference should end.  People of working age should not be solely dependent on an employer or Medicare for their healthcare.  A model where public and private insurance co-exist for those people and isn't tied to employment is where we should be headed as a society.  </p>\n<p>We need to think much harder than we have about what has to change both to account for the deficiencies in our social safety net (that corporations will not fill), and an economy on its way to eliminating entire fields that employ a lot of people today.  <a href=\"https://qz.com/911968/bill-gates-the-robot-that-takes-your-job-should-pay-taxes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bill Gates advocated in favor of a tax on robots</a> year ago.  The challenges of funding UBI and whether or not it's possible to do that and continue to maintain the social safety net as it currently exists need to be faced head-on.  Talking about the minimum wage alone--even as <a href=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/article/2021-minimum-wage-increases-set-to-take-effect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multiple states and localities increase it well beyond the federal minimum</a>--is not enough.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<div>Rahmaan Mwongozi (@TheRocsWorld) recently had one of the few <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQfQv0QnK3I&amp;ab_channel=Roc%27sWorld\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">good-faith conversations</a> I've heard in recent memory regarding the anxieties among those on the political right with Bo Winegard (@EPoe187) on his podcast.  Mwongozi is a talented interviewer, so I was very interested to hear this segment because I felt he would get real answers and he did not disappoint.  The segment is just 11 minutes, and well worth listening to in full.  I explore my take on the conversation below.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>To summarize Winegard's common thread, the angst stems from:</div>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<div>cultural domination of progressive views on race, sex, immigration and other topics in mainstream media and academia</div>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n<div>the distortion or banishment of other views on those topics from those institutions</div>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n<div>the prospect of irreversible cultural change</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>The first point is revealing in a number of ways:</div>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<div>It suggests that despite fairly broad, moderate conservative control of the country's political institutions, conservatives want their views of race, sex, and immigration to control cultural institutions as well</div>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n<div>it suggests that the ongoing, multi-decade project of building competing conservative institutions has failed to produce any prestigious ones</div>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n<div>Note the absence of any explicit mention of economic issues in the list of topics driving conservative angst</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>Winegard's argument that left-of-center views on race, sex, and immigration are more popular culturally seems broadly correct.  His argument that dissenting views are distorted or banished from mainstream institutions may be informed by his own experience (<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/03/12/assistant-professor-says-hes-been-fired-because-he-dared-talk-about-human-population\">https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/03/12/assistant-professor-says-hes-been-fired-because-he-dared-talk-about-human-population</a>), but there are plenty of counter-examples.  The opinion section of any major mainstream newspaper you can name has any number of right-of-center columnists and views on race, sex, immigration, and economics.  It's true of the New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today, and The Wall Street Journal.  You can and do find conservative views from CNN, to MSNBC, to NPR, even PBS.  The prospect of irreversible cultural change is perhaps the most salient fear of conservatives--and as Winegard correctly says later in the interview culture is not merely about demographics but also norms.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Winegard mentions the Hart-Celler Immigration Act of 1965 later in the discussion.  This law made it easier for my parents to come to the United States (though there were Jamaicans in this country well before then, despite the patently racist Johnson-Reed Act of 1924).  The point he goes on to make regarding immigration is that it causes consternation to people (especially more conservative ones) because they are attached to a vision of a country that is more stable.  \"They want stasis.\"</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>One problem I have with this argument is that there are at least as many conservative voices advocating not for stasis (and definitely not for celebration of the country's current diversity, as Winegard does), but for a return to the composition of the country as it was much earlier than 1965.  Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, spoke at length and in laudatory terms of the Johnson-Reed Act and was among the first to support Trump's Muslim ban.  A second problem with this argument is the idea of hurt or injury to people more attached to the country as it was in 1980 or 1990, to use Winegard's years.  It would be one thing if he were citing economic examples, but he doesn't do that.  He doesn't mention immigrants doing the sort of low-skilled labor formerly done by working class white people (or black people for that matter).  He doesn't mention outsourcing.  Winegard provides no qualitative description of the harm caused by immigration either.  A third problem with the stasis argument is the idea that people can become attached to whatever the particular demographics of their area are.  Believing that argument would require you to ignore the entire history (and present) of this country when it comes to segregated schools, segregated housing, and the white flight from diversity in both spheres when the number of black and/or brown people exceeds the level of curation that the legacy of redlining still imposes to a degree.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Mwongozi draws an analogy between the response of black &amp; brown communities to gentrification (in the specific case of Oakland) and the response of white communities to changing demographics.  I can see the argument, but gentrification is not about co-existence.  The end result of gentrification is usually to price out and push out those who were there before.  Black &amp; brown people leave gentrified areas under duress.  Winegard and others might argue that immigration is doing the same to them, but that argument is weaker--and not a strictly economic one.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Winegard takes great pains to draw a distinction between \"ethnotraditionalism\" and white nationalism, and doesn't want to be called a xenophobe for advocating in favor of preserving the current demographics of the country.  Unfortunately for him, louder voices to his political right are the ones that characterize the restrictionist position.  An additional project of many who advocate immigration restrictionism is the political disenfranchisement of black &amp; brown citizens of the United States.  That's what every post-election lawsuit was about.  That's what the sabotage of the 2020 census was about.  That's what the Supreme Court majority's evisceration of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act was about.  That's what every resulting Voter ID law enabled by the Shelby County vs Holder ruling was about.  They do not want non-white citizens of the United States to have a say in the debates and conversations about the trajectory of the country.  It may not be fair to lump Winegard in with those who hold such extreme positions, but that background is why it happens--and will continue to happen until they are clear that they are pro-citizen, regardless of race or ethnicity.</div>\n",

But the moment there's even a chance of the government doing something to help individuals, we get to hear a lot of concern about taxes and budgets, along with faux populism.</p>\n<p>A cursory amount of digging reveals that the picture of who owes student loan debt is different than the stereotypical \"whiny millennial\" (some of whom are much closer to 40 than they are to 20).  A <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/02/03/student-loan-debt-statistics/?sh=3cd4eccc281f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forbes piece from February</a> of this year is particularly enlightening.  The piece is worth reading in full but here are some of the facts I found most interesting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Of the $1.6 trillion in student debt owed, Texas and Florida rank 2nd and 3rd in the number of borrowers and amounts owed (California and New York rank 1st and 4th).</li>\n<li>Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan are also in the top 10 by number of borrowers and amounts owed</li>\n<li>Arizona and Florida rank 1st and 3rd in the nation in average student loan debt per capita</li>\n<li>Over $300 billion of that $1.6 trillion is owed by people aged 50 or older.</li>\n<li>The 50+ cohort of student loan borrowers is about the same size as the 24 and younger cohort (a little over 8 million borrowers), but the amount they owe is nearly triple the size of their younger counterparts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So not only is student loan debt not merely the province of the young, nor is it restricted to \"coastal elites\".  You could be eligible for retirement and still owe Sallie Mae.  If the student loans you owe are private, there's no guarantee that debt will be forgiven upon your death.</p>\n<p>I am quite fortunate when it comes to student loan debt.  Graduating with a computer science degree from a state university with zero debt (thanks to parents who paid in full, and a state smart enough to subsidize in-state tuition) meant that I didn't incur any student loan debt until I decided to go to grad school.  In the interim, I was able to buy a home.</p>\n<p>Attending grad school part-time at night while working full-time (as my parents did for their undergraduate and graduate degrees, while raising my sister and I) and paying at least some tuition while in school mean that the amount I currently owe is well below the average for recent college graduates.  Even so, it will be another decade from now before I've finished paying off Sallie Mae.  I'll be thinking seriously about higher education for my own children then, since my twins will be in high school 10 years from now.</p>\n<p>What the green eyeshade crowd is missing is that the $1.6 trillion owed by students is preventing them from putting their earnings elsewhere in the economy, such as home ownership or investment.  That debt is almost certainly a factor in whether or not people choose to have children.  Akers harking back to an era where a college degree was not a necessity to live a middle class life does not change the facts about the type of globalized economy we live in today.  Nor does it change the fact that automation isn't just changing \"low-skilled\" labor, but also some of the jobs that a college degree formerly provided a gateway to. If you actually want to grow the middle class in the United States in anything approaching a sustainable fashion, a solution to student loan debt (both the current amounts, and a mechanism to prevent forgiven debt from simply growing back to even higher amounts) is just one part of a larger conversation. </p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Wade, no attention has been paid to their stances regarding other issues quite relevant to life--and death. Invalidating restrictions on church occupancy during a pandemic is just one of the ways in which \"pro-life\" applies very poorly to describing where a justice actually stands.  As the clock runs out on the Trump presidency, the Department of Justice under <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/25/politics/barr-trump-federal-executions/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bill Barr is accelerating the pace of executions</a>.  Barrett has already participated in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/amy-coney-barrett-orlando-hall-execution/2020/11/20/ba28d3c6-2b47-11eb-9b14-ad872157ebc9_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">her first capital punishment case on the Supreme Court</a>.  She did not recuse herself, nor register her opposition to the execution going forward as justices in the minority did.</p>\n<p>I suppose it has always been this way, but when a lot of people talk about religious liberty, they only want it for themselves--and no one else.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Even some of those targeted by the caravan rhetoric have not been swayed from their support of Donald Trump.  This election should mark the official death of the \"demographics is destiny\" idea that Democrats have been operating under for many years.

The electorate not seeing fit to punish any of the senators who have enabled all of Trump’s excesses has created a huge opening for a slightly more subtle authoritarian to successfully challenge Biden, Harris, or whoever else the Democrats put up for the presidency in 2024.  Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz, Tucker Carlson, and/or one of Trump’s children seem likely candidates to at minimum form exploratory committees if not follow through and run to succeed Donald Trump.  Even in the event Trump loses the 2020 election, I would not rule out the prospect of Donald Trump running for re-election in 2024.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Senate remaining in GOP hands even if Biden wins kills most (if not all) prospects for meaningful legislation to reform the issues we've seen during the past four years.  If the latest anti-ACA lawsuit succeeds with the 6 conservative justices now seated on the Supreme Court, millions of Americans will lose the healthcare insurance they gained because of it and millions more (including myself) with pre-existing conditions at risk of becoming uninsured (and uninsurable) due to changes in employment.  Without control of the Senate, Democrats would have little power to put a legislative fix into law.  The same would be true of nearly any law the GOP chooses to make a court case out of.  Because this same Senate has stocked the lower court with Trump appointees (mostly political hacks with law degrees rather than serious jurists), such cases reaching SCOTUS if lower courts don't rule the way the GOP prefers seems more likely than not.  GOP control of the Senate almost certainly puts a wrench in any plans Biden has for staffing cabinet and sub-cabinet positions requiring Senate confirmation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While it appears that Biden may yet win the presidency, we know that for the second consecutive election and the third in just 20 years, a minority of American voters has (for now) successfully stymied the will of a majority of American voters at the ballot box thanks to the Electoral College. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Jonathan Chait writes about it at length <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/case-for-liberalism-tom-cotton-new-york-times-james-bennet.html\" target=\"_blank\">in this piece</a>, and argues far more persuasively against \"left illiberalism\" than the vague and anodyne Harper's letter because he is specific.  When I first learned of the Shor firing, it seemed unjust to me--and still does.  His employer did wrong in firing him, and doing so smacks of precisely the sort of \"woke liberalism\" that those to the right on the political spectrum often decry.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another friend of mine asked for my thoughts on J.K. Rowling and Noam Chomsky signing the letter, so I'll address them specifically here. From the little I've seen on Twitter, Rowling is receiving backlash for some <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy\" target=\"_blank\">tweets and more detailed opinions regarding transgender people</a> that could be characterized as transphobic. To me it is unsurprising that Rowling would sign the Harper's letter. There is no downside I can discern to signing onto a vague letter about free speech and tolerance for differing views, but it will not prevent those who see Rowling's positions as transphobic from being any quieter or less vehement in their opposition to her opinion. Chomsky is a scholastic giant who has influenced multiple fields of study. He has been an activist for many causes above and beyond free speech, subjected to multiple arrests, and earned a place on Nixon's enemies list for that activism, so unlike many others on the list he has demonstrated the courage of his convictions for decades.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rasmansa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mansa Keita</a> was on target regarding the objectives of the Harper's letter when he tweeted the following:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The term \"cancel culture\" is simply a rhetorical device meant to control the contours of acceptable speech. The speech and values of those telling you how you should speak is not more privileged than your own.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another friend of mine quite recently described cancel culture as being \"seated somewhere between McCarthyism and market forces\".  I find this description quite apt as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are certainly other examples beyond those I've listed where the expression of one's opinion resulted in them losing a job.  James Damore's firing by Google is one example from my line of work.  Rush Limbaugh getting fired by ESPN some years ago is another.  Twenty years before Colin Kaepernick began the silent protest against police brutality that would ultimately cost him his career, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf was suspended by the NBA for refusing to stand during the anthem.  Whether \"cancellation\" for one's expressed opinion is as prevalent or permanent as some claim is an open question.  So is the assertion that many people are self-censoring due to fear of consequences for speaking out.  Anecdotes (including those I've shared) are not data.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The signatories (all of whom have substantial platforms of their own from which to convey their opinions) seem to be asking for themselves, and presumably other less-powerful people that controversial speech be somehow more privileged than other speech.  They seem to be asking for a \"freedom from consequences\" that Juli Briskman (and certain Unite the Right rally attendees) were not exempt from.  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://digg.com/2020/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-that-harpers-letter-criticizing-cancel-culture-free-speech-censorship\" target=\"_blank\">This piece on Digg</a> goes much further in exploring that ground, and deals more specifically with some of the letter's endorsers.  If freedom from consequences is at heart what the Harper's letter is asking for, how do we square that demand with the current nature of at-will employment?   Instead of vague open letters in magazines with a vanishingly small total circulation, do we reconsider the current nature of at-will employment?  Do we ask employers to be braver?  Do we go so far as to change laws?  Or do we continue to complain about the status quo?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Academic tenure is the concept I think comes closest to what the endorsers of the Harper's letter are asking for.  The intent of academic tenure as I understand it (not being an academic myself) is to preserve the freedom of academics to hold a variety of views.  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://diversityinhighereducation.com/articles/The-Truth-About-Tenure-in-Higher-Education\" target=\"_blank\">Academic tenure is not a guaranteed job for life</a> however, though it is purposely difficult to fire a tenured professor.  By the same token, academic tenure is exceedingly difficult to achieve.  While this does not mean that a tenured professor expressing opinions I find abhorrent would not bother me any less, the difficulty of achieving tenure limits that possibility quite significantly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Gatekeepers in spheres beyond academia no longer command the same power they once did.  First blogging, then social media platforms disintermediated news organizations as ways of getting one's opinion heard more broadly.  YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms added virality to the mix.  These platforms combined with ubiquitous cellphone cameras have disintermediated the police as the only source of information about their activities, providing brutal documentary evidence of the need for the police reforms the Harper's letter calls overdue.  These platforms also make the letter's assertion that the free exchange of ideas is becoming more restricted a somewhat dubious one.  There is probably more free exchange of ideas than ever--but within echo chambers of the like-minded.  Those who believe in all manner of conspiracy theories can easily find their tribe in the same way fans of particular sports teams, musicians, or hobbies can.  Those of us on different sides of any number of issues are more likely to talk past each other--or at each other--than with each other.  The echo chambers and the absence of a shared set of facts may be as much of a danger--if not more so--than \"cancel culture\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Let today’s imaginations take flight. Perhaps commission a statue of Douglass himself delivering this magnificent speech. So much new learning can take place by the presence of both past and present. As a nation, let’s replace a landscape strewn with Confederate symbols with memorialization of emancipation. Tearing down the Freedmen’s Memorial would be a terrible start for that epic process.</blockquote>\nIn response to the Blight column (which I shared with friends on Facebook), one of them asked me if I felt monuments to Thomas Jefferson should be torn down. Here is my response to him:\n<blockquote>The short answer is no. The longer answer is while the hypocrisy of certain of the founders of the United States re: chattel slavery is obvious, they were trying to build a nation. I favor Dr. Blight’s approach of adding more context. The Confederate States of America and those who led it (by contrast) betrayed the nation the founders built and had the explicit goal of breaking this nation in two for the purpose of preserving and expanding the institution of chattel slavery. Statues of those who supported the Confederacy were erected to support the myth of the Lost Cause, and in concert with violence and terrorist acts against black people, despite the defeat of the Confederacy in the Civil War. With the exception of tombstones and gravesites, I would not preserve a single Confederate monument on public land were it up to me. Strike Confederate names from every military base, every road, every school, and/or other public facility as well.</blockquote>\nThe Thomas Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal Basin is a place I've visited many times.  The words of the Declaration of Independence inscribed on one of its panels are clearly at odds with Jefferson's treatment of the enslaved and profit from chattel slavery.  Monticello, Jefferson's primary plantation, is <a href=\"https://www.monticello.org/thomas-jefferson/jefferson-slavery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">attempting to address this contradiction even today</a>.   When it comes to the Founding Fathers, hagiography has characterized too much of our treatment of them.  As more is revealed, it seems that what we have been taught as history looks more like propaganda.  Continued denial of the unsavory, hypocritical, and contradictory beliefs and actions of America's founders serves the nation poorly.  But destruction of their monuments may not serve us any better.\n",

Covid-19 is way bigger than that. “Trump’s handling of the pandemic at home and abroad has exposed more painfully than anything since he took office the meaning of America First,” says William Burns, who was the most senior US diplomat, and is now head of the Carnegie Endowment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It struck me as incorrect because I thought almost immediately of the poor federal response to the devastation in Puerto Rico wrought by hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017.  Plenty of news stories at the time (including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45348356\">this one</a> from the year after the storm) focused on Trump throwing paper towels at a crowd of hurricane survivors.  But a closer look at such stories yields many examples of Trump, his administration, and others connected to them operating the same way nearly 3 years ago as they are now in their response to covid-19.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Looking at how the Trump administration talks about death tolls from covid-19 today, I see many similarities to how they talked about death tolls from the hurricanes in 2017.  In <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-04-30/grim-count-us-virus-toll-passes-trumps-60-000-marker\" target=\"_blank\">this US News &amp; World Report story</a> from last month, Trump is quoted saying he's proud of what his administration has done, as well as insisting the death toll could have been much worse and that no one could have done better.  In 2017, the BBC News story I linked earlier recounts Trump telling Puerto Rican government officials that they should be proud of the low reported death tolls from the two storms.  This led me to another similarity between the handling of the two crises: under-reported death tolls.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The aftermath of the storms in Puerto Rico is when I first encountered the term \"excess mortality\".  Researchers from Harvard did a study (including interviews with some 3000 randomly-selected Puerto Rican households the year after the storms) and estimated that some 4600 people died as a result of the damage done by Hurricane Maria due to interruptions in medical care caused by infrastructure damage such as power cuts and impassable roads, and suicides, as compared to the same time period in the previous year.  The power cuts led me to yet another similarity between the aftermath of the hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the federal response to covid-19: contracts granted due to political connections instead of competence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There have been numerous stories (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2020/05/14/op-ed-gop-fundraiser-under-investigation-for-ppe-business/\" target=\"_blank\">like this one</a>) about GOP fundraiser Mike Gula getting out of the fundraising business to start a company called Blue Flame to sell N95 masks, ventilators, and PPE despite having zero relevant experience.  My home state (Maryland) and Trump's DOJ have both begun investigations into the company after it failed to deliver on contracts it signed.  Nearly 3 years ago, a 2-year-old company with 2 employees named Whitefish Energy won a $300 million no-bid contract to restore Puerto Rico's wrecked power grid.  The Interior Department insisted that Secretary Ryan Zinke played no role, despite his personal connections to the CEO of that company.  Whitefish would ultimately lose that contract and Secretary Zinke would ultimately resign due to pressure from over a dozen different investigations launched into his conduct while serving as interior secretary.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another way that Trump's response to covid-19 was predicted by his response to the hurricanes in Puerto Rico is in how he praised political leaders who played to his ego and blamed those who did not.  <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/353251-trump-praises-puerto-rico-governor-after-slamming-san-juan-mayor\" target=\"_blank\">In this story</a>, Trump is quoted praising then-governor Ricardo Rossello (who had no criticism of federal recovery efforts) while attacking San Juan's mayor (Carmen Yulin Cruz).  His complimentary words to the GOP governors of states (and his attacks on governors Whitmer, Inslee, and others) are very similar.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Further exploration would probably yield more similarities between the botched handling of Puerto Rico's recovery from the hurricanes and the federal government's continuing response to covid-19.  Sadly, the island is not fully-recovered after 3 years and is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-puerto-ricans-newest-struggle-20200506-ujn7bxfu2nan3gdc2rrmip4c74-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">now suffering the additional burden of covid-19</a>.  Denials of housing assistance by FEMA in the immediate aftermath of the hurricanes is inflicting consequences on Puerto Ricans--all US citizens--to this day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This post is the product of a conversation with some friends on Slack, on the topic of billionaires and their philanthropy.  What kicked off this thread of our ongoing conversation was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/18/elon-musk-is-tech-covidiot-no-1-during-coronavirus-pandemic/\">this New York Post</a> piece on Elon Musk.  The column (which is worth reading in full) strings together some of Musk's frankly stupid tweets regarding CoVID-19 before correctly (and brutally) pointing out a few ways his attempts to \"save the day\" have fallen far short of what he promised.  Here's the pull-quote from the piece added to our conversation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Elon, it’s time to take a breath and think — and possibly research work that may not have been done by you — before you speak. Take a page from the founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, and put your money where your big mouth is (without constantly crowing about it). Dorsey, who has <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2020/04/10/rihanna-jack-dorsey-donate-4-2m-to-domestic-violence-victims/?_ga=2.64971247.1304853190.1586893654-942492292.1576790568\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">teamed up with Rihanna and Jay-Z</a> to donate $6.2 million to CoVID-19 relief funds, recently announced the creation of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1247616214769086465\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Start Small LLC</a>, using $1 billion of his own equity to “disarm this pandemic.” After that, the fund will “shift to … health and education” for girls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey\">Jack Dorsey's net worth is slightly south of $4 billion</a>, making his $1 billion offering against the pandemic at least a quarter of his net worth.  The number of other billionaires donating that proportion of their current net worth to such a cause is zero.  While that level of generosity is commendable, American society has become far too dependent on the <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/noblesse%20oblige\">noblesse oblige</a> of billionaires.</p>\n<p>Here's the comment from our conversation that prompted the title of this post:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But whining they [billionaires] aren't donating then whine when they do donate and most people haven't donated is also a double standard.</p>\n<p>Right, the tax code needs to be fixed but the [R]epublicans have basically twisted the logic of \"if you remove these billionaire tax writeoffs and loopholes it's gonna affect average joe making 40k a year\" into the mind of their base.</p>\n<p>It's some of the best marketing I've ever seen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scott Galloway has said something along these lines on at least one occasion: \"philanthropy is marketing.\"  For the various and sundry \"tech bros\" (and others) who do it, it represents a tiny fraction of their net worth for immense reputational gains.  Consider Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million gift to reform public schools in Newark, or the Sackler family's support of the arts.  Whether or not the money had the desired effect is incidental to how the public regards the people who gave the money--it \"launders\" their reputations (a necessary washing in light of what we now know about how they earned their billions).  Even the amount Charles Kushner spent to buy Harvard a building with his name (and incidentally get his son a spot at the school he didn't earn with his grades) somehow counts as philanthropy.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, philanthropy doesn't just rehab reputations.  More and more often it seems to be offered as a substitute for government involvement.  Philanthropy has been offered as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/03/the-conservative-myth-of-a-social-safety-net-built-on-charity/284552/\">a substitute for a social safety net</a> funded with taxes before.  But it hasn't been (nor will it ever be) adequate to the scale of certain problems American society faces, whether we look at schools, poverty, pollution, public health, or any number of other challenges.  The degree to which we have built an expectation of, if not a dependence on, the largesse of the very wealthy for key things is not merely sad but dangerous.  Not only can their interests and focus change in a flash, but we have no mechanism for holding them accountable for failure.  A properly-functioning society cannot and must not let this status quo regarding philanthropy continue.  </p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

This bit of advice comes from my good friend Sandro Fouché, who started the CS program at University of Maryland a few years ahead of me (and has since become a CS professor).  I followed the advice by adding a copy of my current résumé to this blog (though I only make it visible/searchable when I'm actively seeking new work).

It’s how Abigail Fisher received a ruling 7-1 in her favor from the Supreme Court on the basis of the 14th Amendment—one of 3 passed during Reconstruction to recognize and protect the citizenship of newly-freed slaves.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I will extend my observations further, into K-12 education.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The author of the Twitter thread touched not at all on residential segregation—or the funding formulas primarily dependent on property taxes—which have the effect of reinforcing and perpetuating inequitable access to quality teachers and facilities.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">      </span>I’ve read any number of news stories and watched a documentary about wealthier, whiter school districts breaking away from poorer and more diverse ones. This cannot help but impact what every incoming freshman class at colleges and universities nationwide looks like.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This doesn’t mean that there aren’t white people suffering from poverty as well. But a combination of deliberate government action, followed by neglect, combined with white flight does mean the impact of poverty is disproportionately felt by black and brown people.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Zoning decisions as well (for example) tend to result in facilities with negative health impacts being situated near neighborhoods that are predominantly populated by black and brown people.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The reality of residential segregation prompts me to touch on a particular pair of tweets in this thread that stood out for me:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Another thing that bothers me about these movements is their condescending behaviors.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Yesterday, a proponent told me I was tone policing persons of color.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I wasn’t.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I was tone policing an ideology.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Whether you believe it or not, this ideology argues that it is totally reasonable to suggest that, systematically, a woman or POC understands *the* majority viewpoint, but members of the majority cannot understand members of minority group.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a black man who has navigated majority white schools and corporate environments successfully enough to begin making a six figure salary around the time I turned 33, having at least some understanding of the majority viewpoint in those particular context was necessary to achieve some level of success.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I’ve watched enough white flight in real time—even in an allegedly liberal place like Montgomery County, Maryland—over the decades I’ve lived here to be relatively sure that a majority that doesn’t even want to be my neighbor probably isn’t terribly interested in understanding me either.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Whatever you think of D &amp; I efforts in either the academic or corporate spheres (and as an aside I don’t personally believe that representation can or should match nationwide demographics in every field), the argument made in the thread suggests that D &amp; I is somehow more powerful than capitalism—an assertion which beggars belief (to put it mildly).</p>\n",

Instead, we should take a more measured approach, one that, without minimizing the ugly legacy of minstrelsy, allows a modicum of mercy for the accused and accounts for the intentions of the transgressor.”  We’ll call this strike three, because as with seemingly anything involving redress of harm to black people in this country, the “more measured approach” is already regularly-applied–and the way blackface is treated will be no different.\n\nEven as I write this, Northam remains in office, attempts to shame him into resigning having failed.  He is still deploying what others have called “the <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2g5Hz17C4is&amp;t=OWI3YTg2ZDAyMWE2OWEwZGRjZTUwZjczMTc3MjU2NTk5NDM2ZWY5NCx6aTJCdW45RA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AFuCOTqJ4d0GxvAkdc_-a9g&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fscottalawrence.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182723443633%2Fretroactive-repudiation&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shaggy</a> defense”, saying he wasn’t the person in blackface <b>or </b>the person in the Klan hood and robe.  He’s even attempted to pivot to making some sort of racial reconciliation the theme of his remaining years in office.  That effort is off to a <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fstate-watch%2F429335-gayle-king-corrects-northam-for-referring-to-slaves-as-indentured&amp;t=NTc0MGY2YmI0MWY5MjdiN2QwZWVkNjIzZGQ3M2JmZTdkNWI4NjEzNCx6aTJCdW45RA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AFuCOTqJ4d0GxvAkdc_-a9g&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fscottalawrence.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182723443633%2Fretroactive-repudiation&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poor start</a>, since he made the obvious mistake of calling enslaved Africans “indentured servants” before being corrected by his black interviewer, Gayle King.  Mark Herring remains in office as well.\n\nA fourth strike for the piece’s omission of Republicans from among the “professionally offended”.  Despite being a party with a candidate for multiple statewide offices in Virginia who campaigned on preserving Confederate monuments, and <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fstate-watch%2F428975-gop-virginia-senator-oversaw-yearbook-with-racial-slurs-blackface-photos&amp;t=N2MzNDJmY2FlNDIwNjRmYzVlNjExODY1M2E5ODBmMWQwYTRlYzFjYSx6aTJCdW45RA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AFuCOTqJ4d0GxvAkdc_-a9g&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fscottalawrence.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F182723443633%2Fretroactive-repudiation&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a state senate majority leader who edited a yearbook at Virginia Military Institute chock full of racist photos and slurs</a>, this same party (to say nothing of the President of the United States) had the audacity to call for the resignations of Northam, Justin Fairfax (the lieutenant governor facing 2 allegations of sexual assault), and Mark Herring (the attorney general).\n\nHughes quotes Bayard Rustin at length in advocating for his “more measured approach” to those who demonstrated sufficiently poor judgment to think blackface an appropriate thing to do.  Rustin is worth quoting in full here:\n\n“I think the time will come in the future when the Negro will be accepted into the social, economic, and political life of our country when it will no longer be dangerous to do this sort of thing, and then, of course, we would not be opposed to minstrels per se.”\n\nIf NBC executives felt sufficiently comfortable with throwing two black anchors out of their time slot in favor of a white woman with a history of making racist comments, how accepted are black people really in the social and economic life of our country?  If voters could replace the country’s only black president with the man who spent a majority of the preceding decade cheerleading for the birther movement, how accepted are black people really in the political life of our country?  With neighborhoods and schools re-segregating and supposedly-liberal northerners fighting the integration of their schools today, it seems we are a long way from a time when we can afford to tee-hee about minstrelsy.\n",

				"content_text": "<div>I'm no Harvard-trained historian like Leah Wright Rigeur (<a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/leah-wright-rigueur\">https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/leah-wright-rigueur</a>).  I'm a 40-something black man with a wife and 3-year-old twins who has written software (and led teams that write software) for over 20 years.  That experience, my upbringing in Maryland as the son of two Jamaican parents, my travels to various parts of North American, the Caribbean, western Europe, Scandinavia, and my engagement with black conservatives both in my family and acquaintances online give me a different perspective on the topic of race.  While there are certainly mistakes black liberals make when talking about race (if not some of the same mistakes black conservatives make when talking about race), they aren't the focus of this piece.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I focus here on black conservatives because in the Trump era, I think authentic black conservatives are perhaps the only credible voices remaining for an ideology that has otherwise been thoroughly-discredited by the actions and policies of mainstream conservatives in the form of the Republican Party.  I see merit in their pro-family, pro-faith, pro-entrepreneurial, and fiscally conservative positions.  Like them, I also hope to see a political landscape where both major parties are compelled to seek black votes to retain or gain political power with real policy changes, and I believe a black conservatism divorced from mainstream conservative could be a vehicle for that if presented more effectively.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Ta-Nehisi Coates isn't Voldemort</strong></div>\n<div>No one seems to live rent-free in the heads of as many black conservatives as Ta-Nehisi Coates.  I've heard and read criticism of him from Glenn Loury, John McWhorter, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Coleman Hughes, Kmele Foster, and other black conservatives.  Ali has accused him of spreading racial poison.  McWhorter has on multiple occasions mocked Coates because of how much white liberals seem to like his work.  To me, the criticism comes across as more than a little elitist.  Nearly every critic I've named either attended, currently attends, or teaches at an Ivy League university.  Coates by contrast dropped out of Howard University.  By simultaneously not taking the ideas Coates puts forward seriously enough, and by making their criticism more about him and those of his fans who are white than about the flaws in his ideas, all of these critics do the cause of black conservatism a disservice.  In a recent episode of the Fifth Column podcast that's been making the rounds, the panelists (which included a number of the critics named earlier, plus Thomas Chatterton Williams) only reluctantly brought up Coates' name, and after that skirted around it with various euphemisms as if he were a mythic figure instead of a flesh-and-blood person.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>There are substantive grounds on which to challenge the work of Ta-Nehisi Coates.  Having read his essays for a few years now (along with his book Between the World and Me), I think his atheism contributes to making his worldview far too negative.  It also places him outside the traditional of the black Christian church--perhaps the key institution within the black community--which disconnects him from a critical element for understanding how and why the community acts the way it does.  And I say that as someone who respects Coates' work greatly.  Dr. Chidike Okeem has made substantive criticisms of the work (not the man) from a conservative perspective.  Dr. Sandy Darity has also done so.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Coates' black conservative critics would do well to follow the examples of Okeem and Darity.  Conceding that Coates is a talented writer doesn't weaken truly constructive criticism in the least.  Acknowledging that his experience as a child in inner city Baltimore is shared by too many black boys in this country doesn't weaken constructive criticism either.  These concessions and acknowledgements would give the criticism far more credibility than they currently have--or at least help to dispel the impression that the criticisms are due to jealousy or some factor other than fundamental disagreement with Coates' ideas.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Maybe Actually Talk About Race, Instead of Just Dunking on Black People?</strong></div>\n<div>It is entirely possible (if not probable) that there are black conservatives having in-depth and nuanced conversations about blackness, whiteness, and \"otherness\" in America that I've completely missed.  But most of what I see today within mainstream conservatism, black conservatism (both authentic and fake), and from notable figures on the left is dunking on black people.  Glenn Loury at least brings data, and a genuine love for black people to his criticism, but ultimately he's still dunking on black people.  Barack Obama did this at various points throughout his presidency.  Bill Cosby gained even more of a following than he already had for doing this (prior to his downfall for decades of predatory sexual behavior).  Dr. Ben Carson gave speeches on this topic for years before he ran for president and became HUD secretary under Trump.  It seems clear enough that dunking on black people (particularly in front of mostly-white audiences) served the interests of Obama, Cosby, and Carson pretty well (as it did for Bill Clinton during his presidency).  But it definitely didn't help black people.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>To be clear, I'm not saying that discussions of out-of-wedlock births, work ethic,  violence, or criminal behavior are somehow out-of-bounds for discussion.  Exercising agency or personal responsibility (whether your reasons are morality or simple pragmatism) can be a key ally in escaping unfavorable circumstances.  I'm saying that isn't where the discussion should end--and too often black conservatives are in agreement with non-black counterparts.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Among black conservatives, there seems to be an impatience with the relative lack of economic progress of black people since the passage of the Civil Rights, Voting Rights, and Fair Housing Acts in 1964, 1965, and 1968.  They can readily cite many statistics measuring the many ways in which black people are trailing their white, Asian, and Hispanic counterparts in the United States.  Too often unexplored are the variety of ways in which the federal government retreated from full enforcement of civil rights, voting rights, and fair housing on behalf of black people in the same way it did after Reconstruction.  Housing segregation, and the ways in which school funding formulas tend to result in segregated and under-resourced schools.  It is one thing to point out the number of decades that have elapsed since the 1960s and the relatively small amount of progress for black people during that time.  But that lack of progress looks a lot different when you realize that the federal government ceased any real enforcement of those laws after a decade (if even that long).</div>\n",

describe the advocacy efforts of the left for those who are neither white nor male.\n\nAfter getting in his requisite dig at the left regarding their attacks on conservatism, I find it especially puzzling that Sullivan’s conservatism is supposedly “anguished when the criminal justice system loses legitimacy, because of embedded racism.”  I’ve seen precious little evidence that mainstream conservatism sees the criminal justice system as somehow illegitimate because of its disparate treatment of people of color.  Other conservatives, like <a

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David French</a> have publicly rethought certain positions regarding the criminal justice system in the aftermath of Botham Shem Jean’s senseless death at the hands of the police.  Sullivan doesn’t do that here.  Meanwhile, New Yorkers of color alone can point to the abuse of Abner Louima by the police (in 1997), the wrongful death of Patrick Dorismond at the hands of police (in 2000), the conditions of Rikers Island, and other aspects of the criminal justice system to question its legitimacy.\n\nSo-called mainstream conservatism is deathly ill precisely because it lacks sufficient diversity of race, class, gender, and faith both among its most high-profile advocates and its rank-and-file.  The small number of its advocates who are neither white nor male are given prominence only because they speak in favor of the status quo–not for a genuine equality.\n\nSullivan is correct in describing the degree to which the GOP is actively destroying what he sees as the tradition of mainstream conservatism.  They believe in tax cuts to the exclusion of all else–including fiscal solvency.  Their deregulatory fervor will result in an environment that will put our health at risk.  Their unstinting support of Trump lays bare the contempt the GOP has for the rule of law–unless it applies to those they dislike.  Which makes it all the more jarring when he writes: “I also believe we need to slow the pace of demographic and cultural change.”  Whether he intends the statement to do so or not, Sullivan gives aid and comfort not just to the immigration restrictionist, but to Stephen Miller and those like him who seek not to slow the pace of immigration but to reverse it.  When Sullivan writes that “the foreign-born population is at a proportion last seen in 1910″, he effectively endorses the arguments of Jeff Sessions, who spoke glowingly of a 1924 immigration law with the express purpose of keeping Asians, Africans, southern Europeans, and eastern Europeans out of the United States.  He can insist all he wants that seeking to slow the pace of immigration “is not inherently racist”, but when his arguments can’t be meaningfully distinguished from those of Jeff Sessions, he ought not be surprised when he’s not treated as arguing in good faith.\n\nThere might be something to the Sullivan argument regarding “elite indifference to mass immigration”, were it not for the fact of a Senate immigration passed with 68 votes in the recent past that didn’t become law because the GOP-controlled House refused to take it up (perhaps fearing it would pass).  No doubt some in the GOP want cheap, exploitable labor.  The Democrats may indeed encourage it because they think it will get them votes.  Neither of this changes the necessity of immigrants to our labor force.  There are plenty of difficult jobs Americans don’t want to do that immigrants will do.\n\nThe following passage of Sullivan’s latest diary is a fairly tight summary of straw man arguments and falsehoods:\n<blockquote>“A nation has to mean something; to survive, it needs a conservative weaving of past, present, and future, as Burke saw it. And you cannot do that if you see this country as a blight on the face of the earth and an instrument of eternal oppression; or if you replace a healthy, self-critical patriotism with an ugly, racist nationalism that aims to restore the very worst of this country’s past, rather than preserve its extraordinary and near-unique achievements.”</blockquote>\nThere may be some that see the United States of America as a blight and an instrument of “eternal oppression”, but I have my doubts that the majority of the left believes this as he infers.  The idea that this country ever widely believed in a healthy, self-critical patriotism is laughable.  You need only look at school board battles of what to teach our children as history to know that many would prefer to teach them propaganda than the truth. The ugly, racist nationalism to which he refers was never truly past.  It may have retreated into the shadows or underground, but was never entirely gone.  The continuing battle over Confederate monuments and the endurance of the Lost Cause myth should be sufficient evidence of that.\n\nSullivan’s idea that somehow a healthy conservatism would rescue the United States from the position it finds itself in is wishful thinking.  Without an honest reckoning with Barry Goldwater’s role in shaping what conservatism has become, and how easily the purported conservative party was taken over by Trump, mainstream conservatism will be fully and deservedly discredited.\n",

Even if such old studies were relevant today, more current and relevant data debunks the citations Damore uses. To cite just two examples:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Particularly in the case of computing, the idea that women are somehow biologically less-suited for software development as a field is proven laughably false by simply looking at the history of computing as a field.  Before computers were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->electro-mechanical machines<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, they were actually human beings&ndash;often women. The movie <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hidden Figures<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dramatized the role of black women in the early successes of the manned space program, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->many women were key to advances in computing both before and after that time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Women authored foundational work in computerized algebra, wrote the first compiler, were key to the creation of Smalltalk (the first object-oriented programming language), helped pioneer information retrieval and natural language process, and much more.</p>\n<p>My second major issue with the paper is its intellectual dishonesty.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Business Insider piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I linked earlier covers the logical fallacy at the core of Damore&rsquo;s argument very well.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This brilliant piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Dr. Cynthia Lee (computer science lecturer at Stanford) does it even better and finally touches directly on the topic I&rsquo;m headed to next: race.  Dr. Lee notes quite insightfully that Damore&rsquo;s citations on biological differences don&rsquo;t extend to summarizing race and IQ studies as an explanation for the lack of black software engineers (either at Google or industry-wide).  I think this was a conscious omission that enabled at least some in the press who you might expect to know better (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Brooks being one prominent example<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) to defend this memo to the point of saying the CEO should resign.</p>\n<p>It is also notable that though Damore claims to &ldquo;value diversity and inclusion&rdquo;, he objects to every means that Google has in place to foster them.  His objections to programs that are race or gender-specific struck a particular nerve with me as a University of Maryland graduate who was attending the school when the federal courts ruled the Benjamin Banneker Scholarship could no longer be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exclusively for black students<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The University of Maryland had a long history of discrimination against blacks students (including Thurgood Marshall, most famously).  The courts ruled this way despite the specific history of the school (which kept blacks out of the law school until 1935 and the rest of the university until 1954.  In the light of that history, it should not be a surprise that you wouldn&rsquo;t need an entire hand to count the number of black graduates from the School of Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences in the winter of 1996 when I graduated.  There were only 2 or 3 black students, and I was one of them (and I&rsquo;m not certain the numbers would have improved much with a spring graduation).</p>\n<p>It is rather telling how seldom preferences like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->legacy admissions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at elite universities (or the preferential treatment of the children of large donors) are singled out for the level of scrutiny and attack that affirmative action receives.  Damore and others of his ilk who attack such programs never consider how the K-12 education system of the United States, funded by property taxes, locks in the advantages of those who can afford to live in wealthy neighborhoods (and the disadvantages of those who live in poor neighborhoods) as a possible cause for the disparities in educational outcomes.</p>\n<p>My third issue with Damore&rsquo;s memo is the assertion that Google&rsquo;s hiring practices can effectively lower the bar for &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; candidates.  I can say from my personal experience with at least parts of the interviewing processes at Google (as well as other major names in technology like Facebook and Amazon) that the bar to even get past the first round, much less be hired is extremely high.  They were, without question, the most challenging interviews of my career to date (19 years and counting). A related issue with representation (particularly of blacks and Hispanics) at major companies like these is the recruitment pipeline.  Companies (and people who were computer science undergrads with me who happen to be white) often argue that schools aren&rsquo;t producing enough black and Hispanic computer science graduates.  But <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very recent data<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the Department of Education seems to indicate that there are more such graduates than companies acknowledge. Furthermore, these companies all recruit from the same small pool of exclusive colleges and universities despite the much larger number of schools that turn out high quality computer science graduates on an annual basis (which may explain the multitude of social media apps coming out of Silicon Valley instead of applications that might meaningfully serve a broader demographic).</p>\n<p>Finally, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as Yonatan Zunger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> said quite eloquently, Damore appears to not understand engineering.  Nothing of consequence involving software (or a combination of software and hardware) can be built successfully without collaboration.  The larger the project or product, the more necessary collaboration is.  Even the software engineering course that all University of Maryland computer science students take before they graduate requires you to work with a team to successfully complete the course.  Working effectively with others has been vital for every system I&rsquo;ve been part of delivering, either as a developer, systems analyst, dev lead or manager.</p>\n<p>As long as I have worked in the IT industry, regardless of the size of the company, it is still notable when I&rsquo;m not the only black person on a technology staff.  It is even rarer to see someone who looks like me in a technical leadership or management role (and I&rsquo;ve been in those roles myself a mere 6 of my 19 years of working).  Damore and others would have us believe that this is somehow the just and natural order of things when nothing could be further from the truth.  If &ldquo;at-will employment&rdquo; means anything at all, it appears that Google was within its rights to terminate Damore&rsquo;s employment if certain elements of his memo violated the company code of conduct.  Whether or not Damore should have been fired will no doubt continue to be debated.  But from my perspective, the ideas in his memo are fairly easily disproven.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "I've shared a few articles on Facebook regarding the now infamous \"manifesto\" (available in full <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>) written by James Damore.  But I'm (finally) writing my own response to it because being black makes me part of <a href=\"http://cra.org/crn/2015/09/expanding-the-pipeline-the-state-of-african-americans-in-computer-science-the-need-to-increase-representation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a group even more poorly represented in computer science</a> (to say nothing of other STEM fields) than women (though black women are even less represented in STEM fields).\n\nOne of my many disagreements with Damore's work (beyond its muddled and poorly written argument) is how heavily it leans on <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/james-damore-diversity-manifesto-science-logical-fallacy-2017-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">citations of very old studies</a>. Even if such old studies were relevant today, more current and relevant data debunks the citations Damore uses. To cite just two examples:\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://ngcproject.org/statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Women earned 57.3% of bachelor’s degrees in all fields in 2013 and 50.3% of science and engineering bachelor’s degrees.</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://hbr.org/product/the-athena-factor-reversing-the-brain-drain-in-science-engineering-and-technology/10094-PDF-ENG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">41% of highly qualified scientists, engineers, and technologists on the lower rungs of corporate career ladders are female.</a></li>\n</ul>\nPer these statistics, women are not underrepresented at the undergraduate level in these technical fields and only slightly underrepresented once they enter the workforce.  So how is it that we get to the point where women are so significantly underrepresented in tech?  <a href=\"http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics-stem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Multiple recent studies suggest</a> that factors such as isolation, hostile male-dominated work environments, ineffective executive feedback, and a lack of effective sponsors lead women to leave science, engineering and technology fields at double the rate of their male counterparts.  So despite Damore's protestations, women are earning entry-level STEM degrees at roughly the same rate as men and are pushed out.\n\nParticularly in the case of computing, the idea that women are somehow biologically less-suited for software development as a field is proven laughably false by simply looking at the history of computing as a field.  Before computers were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">electro-mechanical machines</a>, they were actually human beings--often women. The movie <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a24429/hidden-figures-real-story-nasa-women-computers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hidden Figures</a> dramatized the role of black women in the early successes of the manned space program, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many women were key to advances in computing both before and after that time</a>.  Women authored foundational work in computerized algebra, wrote the first compiler, were key to the creation of Smalltalk (the first object-oriented programming language), helped pioneer information retrieval and natural language process, and much more.\n\nMy second major issue with the paper is its intellectual dishonesty.  The <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/james-damore-diversity-manifesto-science-logical-fallacy-2017-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Business Insider piece</a> I linked earlier covers the logical fallacy at the core of Damore's argument very well.  <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/8/11/16130452/google-memo-women-tech-biology-sexism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This brilliant piece</a> by Dr. Cynthia Lee (computer science lecturer at Stanford) does it even better and finally touches directly on the topic I'm headed to next: race.  Dr. Lee notes quite insightfully that Damore's citations on biological differences don't extend to summarizing race and IQ studies as an explanation for the lack of black software engineers (either at Google or industry-wide).  I think this was a conscious omission that enabled at least some in the press who you might expect to know better (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/opinion/sundar-pichai-google-memo-diversity.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Brooks being one prominent example</a>) to defend this memo to the point of saying the CEO should resign.\n\nIt is also notable that though Damore claims to \"value diversity and inclusion\", he objects to every means that Google has in place to foster them.  His objections to programs that are race or gender-specific struck a particular nerve with me as a University of Maryland graduate who was attending the school when the federal courts ruled the Benjamin Banneker Scholarship could no longer be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/02/us/impact-of-court-ruling-on-black-scholarships.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exclusively for black students</a>.  The University of Maryland had a long history of discrimination against blacks students (including Thurgood Marshall, most famously).  The courts ruled this way despite the specific history of the school (which kept blacks out of the law school until 1935 and the rest of the university until 1954.  In the light of that history, it should not be a surprise that you wouldn't need an entire hand to count the number of black graduates from the School of Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences in the winter of 1996 when I graduated.  There were only 2 or 3 black students, and I was one of them (and I'm not certain the numbers would have improved much with a spring graduation).\n\nIt is rather telling how seldom preferences like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/06/opinion/college-legacy-admissions-affirmative-action-for-whites.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">legacy admissions</a> at elite universities (or the preferential treatment of the children of large donors) are singled out for the level of scrutiny and attack that affirmative action receives.  Damore and others of his ilk who attack such programs never consider how the K-12 education system of the United States, funded by property taxes, locks in the advantages of those who can afford to live in wealthy neighborhoods (and the disadvantages of those who live in poor neighborhoods) as a possible cause for the disparities in educational outcomes.\n\nMy third issue with Damore's memo is the assertion that Google's hiring practices can effectively lower the bar for \"diversity\" candidates.  I can say from my personal experience with at least parts of the interviewing processes at Google (as well as other major names in technology like Facebook and Amazon) that the bar to even get past the first round, much less be hired is extremely high.  They were, without question, the most challenging interviews of my career to date (19 years and counting). A related issue with representation (particularly of blacks and Hispanics) at major companies like these is the recruitment pipeline.  Companies (and people who were computer science undergrads with me who happen to be white) often argue that schools aren't producing enough black and Hispanic computer science graduates.  But <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/upshot/dont-blame-recruiting-pipeline-for-lack-of-diversity-in-tech.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">very recent data</a> from the Department of Education seems to indicate that there are more such graduates than companies acknowledge. Furthermore, these companies all recruit from the same small pool of exclusive colleges and universities despite the much larger number of schools that turn out high quality computer science graduates on an annual basis (which may explain the multitude of social media apps coming out of Silicon Valley instead of applications that might meaningfully serve a broader demographic).\n\nFinally, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/so-about-this-googlers-manifesto-1e3773ed1788\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as Yonatan Zunger</a> said quite eloquently, Damore appears to not understand engineering.  Nothing of consequence involving software (or a combination of software and hardware) can be built successfully without collaboration.  The larger the project or product, the more necessary collaboration is.  Even the software engineering course that all University of Maryland computer science students take before they graduate requires you to work with a team to successfully complete the course.  Working effectively with others has been vital for every system I've been part of delivering, either as a developer, systems analyst, dev lead or manager.\n\nAs long as I have worked in the IT industry, regardless of the size of the company, it is still notable when I'm not the only black person on a technology staff.  It is even rarer to see someone who looks like me in a technical leadership or management role (and I've been in those roles myself a mere 6 of my 19 years of working).  Damore and others would have us believe that this is somehow the just and natural order of things when nothing could be further from the truth.  If \"at-will employment\" means anything at all, it appears that Google was within its rights to terminate Damore's employment if certain elements of his memo violated the company code of conduct.  Whether or not Damore should have been fired will no doubt continue to be debated.  But from my perspective, the ideas in his memo are fairly easily disproven.\n",

				"content_text": "I originally wrote the following as an internal corporate blog post to guide a pair of business analysts responsible for writing and unit testing business rules. The advice below applies pretty well to software testing in general.\n<h3><strong>80/20 Rule</strong></h3>\n80% of your test scenarios should cover failure cases, with the other 20% covering success cases.  Too much of testing (unit testing or otherwise) seems to cover the happy path.  A 4:1 ratio of failure case tests to success case tests will result in more durable software.\n<h3><strong>Boundary/Range Testing</strong></h3>\nGiven a range of valid values for an input, the following tests are strongly recommended:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Test of behavior at minimum value in range</li>\n \t<li>Test of behavior at maximum value in range</li>\n \t<li>Tests outside of valid value range\n<ul>\n \t<li>Below minimum value</li>\n \t<li>Above maximum value</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Test of behavior within the range</li>\n</ul>\nThe following tests roughly conform to the 80/20 rule, and apply to numeric values, dates and times.\n<h3><strong>Date/Time Testing</strong></h3>\nAbove and beyond the boundary/range testing described above, the testing of dates creates a need to test how code handles different orderings of those values relative to each other.  For example, if a method has a start and end date as inputs, you should test to make sure that the code responds with some sort of error if the start date is later than the end date.  If a method has start and end times as inputs for the same day, the code should respond with an error if the start time is later than the end time.  Testing of date or date/time-sensitive code must include an abstraction to represent current date and time as a value (or values) you choose, rather than the current system date and time.  Otherwise, you'll have no way to test code that should only be executed years in the future.\n<h3><strong>Boolean Testing</strong></h3>\nGiven that a boolean value is either true or false, testing code that takes a boolean as an input seems quite simple.  But if a method has multiple inputs that can be true or false, testing that the right behavior occurs for every possible combination of those values becomes less trivial.  Combine that with the possibility of a null value, or multiple null values being provided (as described in the next section) and comprehensive testing of a method with boolean inputs becomes even harder.\n<h3><strong>Null Testing</strong></h3>\nIt is very important to test how a method behaves when it receives null values instead of valid data.  The method under test should fail in graceful way instead of crashing or displaying cryptic error messages to the user.\n<h3><strong>Arrange-Act-Assert</strong></h3>\nArrange-Act-Assert is the organizing principle to follow when developing unit tests.  <strong>Arrange</strong> refers to the work your test should do first in order to set up any necessary data, creation of supporting objects, etc.  <strong>Act</strong> refers to executing the scenario you wish to test.  <strong>Assert</strong> refers to verifying that the outcome you expect is the same as the actual outcome.  A test should have just one assert.  The rationale for this relates to the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/a/computechinc.com/file/d/0ByOwmqah_nuGNHEtcU5OekdDMkk/view\" rel=\"nofollow\">Single Responsibility Principle</a>.  That principles states that a class should have one, and only one, reason to change.  As I apply that to testing, a unit test should test only one thing so that the reason for failure is clear if and when that happens as a result of subsequent code changes.  This approach implies a large number of small, targeted tests, the majority of which should cover failure scenarios as indicated by the 80/20 Rule defined earlier.\n<h3><strong>Test-First Development &amp; Refactoring</strong></h3>\nThis approach to development is best visually explained by <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html#Figure1StepsOfTDD\" rel=\"nofollow\">this diagram</a>.  The key thing to understand is that a test that fails must be written <strong>before</strong> the code that makes the test pass.  This approach ensures that test is good enough to catch any failures introduced by subsequent code changes.  This approach applies not just to new development, but to refactoring as well.  This means, if you plan to make a change that you know will result in broken tests, <strong>break the tests first.</strong>  This way, when your changes are complete, the tests will be green again and you'll know your work is done.  You can find an excellent blog post on the subject of test-driven development by Bob Martin <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\n<h3><strong>Other Resources</strong></h3>\nI first learned about Arrange-Act-Assert for unit test organization from reading <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/the-art-of-unit-testing-second-edition\">The Art of Unit Testing</a> by Roy Osherove.  He's on Twitter as @RoyOsherove.  While it's not just about testing, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=pd_sim_14_10?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0132350882&amp;pd_rd_r=K179AJ7AZSZKF5C35XWQ&amp;pd_rd_w=jq9Ib&amp;pd_rd_wg=45NJD&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=K179AJ7AZSZKF5C35XWQ\">Clean Code</a> (by Bob Martin) is one of those books you should own and read regularly if you make your living writing software.\n",

Perhaps their implementation of a flat organizational structure means that developers take on multiple tasks beyond development (not uncommon in startup environments).

				"content_text": "<div>During the past year-and-a-half as a software development manager for a local consulting firm, I've tried a number of different tools and techniques to keep me organized.  As my role expanded to include business development, hiring, and project management tasks, there's been a lot more to keep track of.  I meet weekly or twice-monthly 1-on-1 with each team member on my current project.  \"Move it out of e-mail\" is my primary objective for getting organized.  The rest of this post will elaborate on the specific alternatives to e-mail that I tried on the way to my current \"manager tools\".</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>Outlook</b></div>\n<div>Beyond e-mail and calendar functionality, Outlook offers a To-Do List and Tasks for keeping organized.  Both provide start dates and due dates.  The To-Do List is tied directly to individual e-mails, while Tasks are stand-alone items.  I abandoned the use of task functionality pretty quickly.  I used the To-Do List as recently as July of this year, but I see it as a bad habit now.  I rarely end up clearly the various options to flag an e-mail for follow-up (Today, Tomorrow, This Week, Next Week, No Date &amp; Custom), so they become an ever-growing list where I only very occasionally mark items as complete.  In addition, the search functionality in Outlook never works as well as I need it to when I'm trying to find something.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>Lighthouse</b></div>\n<div>Once I passed the six month mark with my employer, I felt comfortable enough to introduce weekly 1-on-1s as a practice on my project.  After a couple of weeks of filling out a paper template from <a href=\"https://www.manager-tools.com/\">these guys</a> for each team member on my project, the need for a better solution became readily apparent.  Lighthouse is the name of the company and their product, a web-based application for managing your 1-on-1s with staff.  After the free trial, I chose not to renew.  While I like Lighthouse, and the cost wasn't prohibitive, my employer wasn't going to pay for it.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I liked the ideas in Lighthouse enough that I tried to build a simpler, custom version of it myself.  Increasing work responsibilities (and the birth of my twins, Elliott and Emily) erased the free time I had for that side project.  Lighthouse maintains a <a href=\"https://getlighthouse.com/blog/\">leadership and management blog</a> that I've found to be worthwhile reading.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>Trello</b></div>\n<div>I first started using <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello </a>years ago for something not at all related to work--requesting bug fixes and enhancements to a custom website my fantasy football league uses.  I didn't consider using it for work until I was re-introduced to it by a VP who uses it to keep himself organized.  Once I reviewed a few example boards and set up a board to moderate weekly business development meeting, new possibilities for its use revealed themselves very quickly.  As of today, I've got 4 different boards active: 1 for \"hiring funnel\" activities, another board for business development tasks, a 3rd for project-specific tasks that don't fall into a current Scrum sprint, and a 4th board as a general to-do list.  The last board turned out to be a great solution for capturing information from my 1-on-1 meetings.  It also tracks my progress toward annual goals, training reminders, and other \"good corporate citizen\" tasks.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The free tier of Trello service offers the functionality that matters most:</div>\n<ul>\n \t<li>create multiple boards</li>\n \t<li>define workflows as simple or complex as you need</li>\n \t<li>create cards as simple or complex as you need</li>\n</ul>\n<div></div>\n<div>Markdown formatting, attachment support, due dates, checklists, archiving, the ability to subscribe to individual cards, lists and/or boards and collaborate with other team members of Trello combined with the key functionality above has helped me become much better organized and able to communicate more consistently with my team members and executives in my organization.  The search capability works much better for me than Outlook as well.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>I've only gotten a handful of co-workers in my organization to adopt Trello so far, but I keep <a href=\"https://trello.com/scottalawrence/recommend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recommending it to other co-workers</a>.  I'd like to see our entire business unit adopt it officially so we can take advantage of the capabilities available at the Business Class tier.</div>\n",

				"content_text": "I had an interesting conversation with a friend of mine (a computer science professor) and one of his students last week.  Beyond the basic which language(s) question were a couple more intriguing ones:\n<ol>\n \t<li>If you had to do it all over again, would you still stick with the Microsoft platform for your entire development career?</li>\n \t<li>Will Microsoft be relevant in another ten years?</li>\n</ol>\nThe first question I hadn't really contemplated in quite some time.  I distinctly recall a moment when there was a choice between two projects at the place where I was working--one project was a Microsoft project (probably ASP, VB6 and SQL Server) and the other one wasn't (probably Java).  I chose the former because I'd had prior experience with all three of the technologies on the Microsoft platform and none with the others.  I probably wanted an early win at the company and picking familiar technology was the quickest way to accomplish that.  A couple of years later (in 2001), I was at another company and took them up on an opportunity to learn about .NET (which at the time was still in beta) from the people at DevelopMentor.  It only took one presentation by Don Box to convince me that .NET (and C#) were the way to go.  While it would be two more years before I wrote and deployed a working C# application to production, I've been writing production applications (console apps, web forms, ASP.NET MVC) in C# from then to now.  While it's difficult to know for sure how that other project (or my career) would have turned out had I gone the Java route instead of the Microsoft route, I suspect the Java route would have been better.\n\nOne thing that seemed apparent even in 1999 was that Java developers (the good ones anyway) had a great grasp of object-oriented design (the principles Michael Feathers would apply the acronym <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SOLID</a> to).  In addition, quite a number of open source and commercial software products were being built in Java.  The same could not be said of C# until much later.\n\nTo the question of whether Microsoft will still be relevant in another ten years, I believe the answer is yes.  With Satya Nadella at the helm, Microsoft seems to be doubling-down on their efforts to maintain and expand their foothold in the enterprise space.  There are still tons of business of various sizes (not to mention state governments and the federal government) that view Microsoft as a familiar and safe choice both for COTS solutions and custom solutions.  So I expect it to remain possible to have a long and productive career writing software with the Microsoft platform and tools.\n\nAs more and more software is written for the web (and mobile browsers), whatever \"primary\" language a developer chooses (whether Java, C#, or something else altogether), they would be wise to learn JavaScript in significant depth.  One of the trends I noticed over the past couple of years of regularly attending .NET user groups, fewer and fewer of the talks had much to do with the intricacies and syntactic tricks of Microsoft-specific technologies like C# or LINQ.  There would be talks about <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bootstrap</a>, <a href=\"http://knockoutjs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Knockout.js</a>, <a href=\"https://nodejs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">node.js</a>, <a href=\"https://angularjs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Angular</a>, and JavaScript.  Multiple presenters, including those who worked for Microsoft partners advocated quite effectively for us to learn these technologies in addition to what Microsoft put on the market in order to help us make the best, most flexible and responsive web applications we could.  Even if you're writing applications in PHP or Python, JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks are becoming a more significant part of the web every day.\n\nOne other language worth knowing is SQL.  While NoSQL databases seem to have a lot of buzz these days, the reality is that there is tons of structured, relational data in companies and governments of every size.  There are tons of applications that still remain to be written (not to mention the ones in active use and maintenance) that expose and manipulate data stored in Microsoft (or Sybase) SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and Postgresql.  Many of the so-called business intelligence projects and products today have a SQL database as one of any number of data sources.\n\nPerhaps the best advice about learning programming languages comes from The Pragmatic Programmer:\n<blockquote>Learn at least one new language every year.</blockquote>\nOne of a number of useful things about a good computer science program is that after teaching you fundamentals, they push you to apply those fundamentals in multiple programming languages over the course of a semester or a year.  Finishing a computer science degree should not mean the end of striving to learn new languages.  They give us different tools for solving similar problems--and that ultimately helps make our code better, regardless of what language we're writing it in.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>One requirement I received for a recent ASP.NET MVC form implementation was that particular radio buttons be checked on the basis of other radio buttons being checked. Because it&rsquo;s a relatively simple form, I opted to fulfill the requirement with just jQuery instead of adding knockout.js as a dependency.</p>\n<p>Our HTML helper for radio button lists is not much different than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  So the first task was to identify whether or not the radio button checked was the one that should trigger another action.  As has always been the case when grouping radio buttons in HTML, each radio button in the group shares the same name and differs by id and value.  The HTML looks kind of like this:\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n@Html.RadioButtonListFor(m =&gt; m.Choice.Id, Model.Choice.Id, Model.ChoiceListItems)\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>where ChoiceListItems is a list of System.Web.Mvc.SelectListItem and the ids are strings.  The jQuery to see if a radio button in the group has been checked looks like this:\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n$(&ldquo;input[name=&lsquo;Choice.Id&rsquo;]&quot;).change(function(){\n&hellip;\n}\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Having determined that a radio button in the group has been checked, we must be more specific and see if the checked radio button is the one that should trigger additional action. To accomplish this, the code snippet above is changed to the following:\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n$(&ldquo;input[name=&lsquo;Choice.Id&rsquo;]&quot;).change(function(){\nif($(&ldquo;input[name=&lsquo;Choice.Id&rsquo;]:checked&rdquo;).val() == &lsquo;@Model.SpecialChoiceId&rsquo;){\n&hellip;\n}\n}\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The SpecialChoiceId value is retrieved from the database.

				"content_text": "One requirement I received for a recent ASP.NET MVC form implementation was that particular radio buttons be checked on the basis of other radio buttons being checked. Because it's a relatively simple form, I opted to fulfill the requirement with just jQuery instead of adding knockout.js as a dependency.\n\nOur HTML helper for radio button lists is not much different than <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/657164/Radio-Button-List-for-MVC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this one</a>.  So the first task was to identify whether or not the radio button checked was the one that should trigger another action.  As has always been the case when grouping radio buttons in HTML, each radio button in the group shares the same name and differs by id and value.  The HTML looks kind of like this:\n<code>\n@Html.RadioButtonListFor(m =&gt; m.Choice.Id, Model.Choice.Id, Model.ChoiceListItems)\n</code>\n\nwhere ChoiceListItems is a list of System.Web.Mvc.SelectListItem and the ids are strings.  The jQuery to see if a radio button in the group has been checked looks like this:\n<code>\n$(\"input[name='Choice.Id']\").change(function(){\n...\n}\n</code>\n\nHaving determined that a radio button in the group has been checked, we must be more specific and see if the checked radio button is the one that should trigger additional action. To accomplish this, the code snippet above is changed to the following:\n<code>\n$(\"input[name='Choice.Id']\").change(function(){\nif($(\"input[name='Choice.Id']:checked\").val() == '@Model.SpecialChoiceId'){\n...\n}\n}\n</code>\n\nThe SpecialChoiceId value is retrieved from the database. It's one of the values used when building the ChoiceListItems collection mentioned earlier (so we know a match is possible). Now the only task that remains is to check the appropriate radio button in the second grouping. I used jQuery's <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/multiple-attribute-selector/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multiple attribute selector</a> for this task.  Here's the code:\n<code>\n$(\"input[name='Choice.Id']\").change(function(){\n if($(\"input[name='Choice.Id']:checked\").val() == '@Model.SpecialChoiceId'){\n  $(\"input[name='Choice2.Id'][value='@Model.Choice2TriggerId']\").prop('checked',true);\n }\n}\n</code>\n\nThe first attribute filter selects the second radio button group, the second attribute filter selects the specific radio button, and prop('checked',true) adds the 'checked' attribute to the HTML.  Like SpecialChoiceId, Choice2TriggerId is retrieved from the database (RavenDB in our specific case).\n",

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.hanselminutes.com/427/what-it-really-means-to-be-junior-developer-with-jonathan-barronville\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hanselminutes #427</a>  was an excellent interview with Jonathan Barronville, the author (perhaps the most intelligent and articulate 19-year-old I've ever heard) of <a href=\"https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/what-it-really-means-to-be-a-junior-developer-266acb772b4b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this article</a> on Medium.  The discussion covered a lot of ground, and posed a number of thought-provoking questions.  Three of the questions struck me as especially important.</p>\n<p><strong>What is senior?</strong></p>\n<p>In the podcast, Hanselman suggested three criteria: years in industry, years writing code in a language, and age.  Since I’ve been in the industry for 18 years, have been writing production C# code for about 10 of them, and turned 40 at the beginning of the year, those criteria argue in favor of me being considered senior.  Those numbers can also work against me in a way (and not just because of the field’s well-known problems with age discrimination).  Before I took my current job (over 2 years ago), I hadn’t written any production ASP.NET MVC, jQuery or knockout.js.  The last time I’d written any production JavaScript before then was before also jQuery and node.js even existed.  So from the perspective of those technologies, I was junior (and still am in some respects).</p>\n<p>While industry today seems to have a fetish for young developers, there is merit to that interest in one respect.  Men and women entering the industry right now, whether they’re fresh out of college (or even younger) are too young to have any memory of a world where Google didn’t exist.  They’re too young to remember a world before web pages.  Some of them have been writing software for the majority of their lives.  It’s natural to them in a way it wasn’t for me because I had to go to college to get access to really good computers and high-speed Internet.</p>\n<p>That said, the number of years (or lack of them) isn’t an advantage or disadvantage if you haven’t had the sort of experiences you can grow from as a developer (and learned the right lessons from them).  Regardless of what age you were when you had the experiences, if you’ve had to build software that solved enterprise-level problems, dealt with scaling, refactoring and enhancement of large systems, or integration of systems, both succeeding <strong>and </strong>failing at addressing those challenges are what really make a senior developer.  More time in industry may give someone more opportunities to have those experiences, but if they haven’t had them, they’ve just been writing software for a long time.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the rush to be senior?</strong></p>\n<p>Hanselman made a comparison between tradesmen like carpenters and plumbers (who have to work as apprentices for 3-5 years and pass an exam before they can become journeymen) and our industry, where someone can have senior in their title without much experience.  While some of it (if not most of it) has to do with pay, there are drawbacks.  Because our field is relatively young in the grand scheme of things, there aren’t universally accepted standards and practices (especially compared to some branches of engineering, which have hundreds of years of history).  We place too much of a premium on speed, and not enough on depth of experience (and the time it takes to earn it).  One of the end results of this is the sort of interviews I’ve experienced on a regular basis.  I’ve seen tons of resumes from people with senior titles who are stymied by interview exercises that ask fairly basic questions (on the level of the <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest\">Fizz Buzz</a> test).</p>\n<p>I’d been working for less than four years when I first got “senior” added to my title.  It came with a nice raise (which I was certainly happy about) and more responsibilities (team leadership), but I certainly wasn’t senior in terms of software development experience after that short a period of time.  Not unlike what the <a href=\"http://norvig.com/21-days.html\">classic Peter Norvig essay</a> suggests about teaching yourself programming in ten years, that’s about how long it took for me to see myself as legitimately senior from an experience perspective.  Even now, having spent over 17 years in industry, I’m sure there are workplaces where I wouldn’t be considered senior because I haven’t architected super-large systems or led a team with dozens of people—and I’m alright with that.  I’ve matured enough after this amount of time to be more concerned with what kind of work I’m doing (and what I’m learning) than I am with what title an employer gives me.</p>\n<p><strong>Are we okay with not knowing something and then learning?</strong></p>\n<p>This question points in two directions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are we okay with ourselves not knowing something and then having to learn it?</li>\n<li>are we okay with others not knowing something and then having to learn it?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For me, the answer to the first question is yes.  In the case jQuery and knockout.js (and other unfamiliar technologies like RavenDB), I had to be okay with not knowing.  Doing my own research, and not being too proud to ask a lot of questions younger developers on the team who clearly had more experience with those technologies was necessary to advance to the point where I could do all that work myself.</p>\n<p>The answer to the second question is the key to many of the problems with our industry, particularly when it comes to issues of gender and diversity.  Too many in our industry go beyond not being okay with someone not knowing something and cross the line to being condescending, rude, and even hostile.  I’ve been on the receiving end of that kind of treatment more often than I care to remember.  Too many workplaces allow people with superior technical skills to act like children instead of adults in interacting with their co-workers.  There is more and more being written about the sexism in the industry (pieces like <a href=\"http://butyoureagirl.com/2014/04/09/technologys-culture-problem/\">this one</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html?_r=0\">this one</a>), but not nearly enough on the negative impact that environment has on the ability and desires of others to learn and grow as professionals.  I think the persistently low numbers of minorities and women in the tech industry has as much to do with the perception (if not reality) that a lot of tech companies have high “<a href=\"http://www.blogging4jobs.com/hr/managing-talent-asshole-threshold/#rcBQOS8j2Ytle4Bd.97\">a**hole thresholds</a>” as it does with insufficient exposure to math and science in school.</p>\n<p>The bottom line for me from the article and the podcast is not only that everyone in this industry starts out as junior level, but that technology changes so quickly that we will all be junior at something at multiple points throughout our careers in the tech industry.  We need to keep that knowledge in mind so that we can be more patient with ourselves as we learn <strong>and </strong>with those we work with as they learn.</p>\n",

				"title": "When Third-Party Dependencies Attack",
				"content_html": "<p>Last week provided our office with an inconvenient lesson in what can happen when third-party dependencies break in unanticipated ways.  PostSharp is a key third-party dependency in the line of business web application we sell.  On the morning of May 20, our continuous integration server (we use TeamCity) began indicating a build failure with the following message:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Reading the entire explanation is worthwhile, but the key reason for the failure is this:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>There are many lessons to be learned (or re-learned) from what we experienced with PostSharp, but I&rsquo;ll talk about three.  First, if a third-party dependency is critical to your application and has a licensing option that includes support, it is best to pay the money so that you have recourse if and when there&rsquo;s an issue.  On the Microsoft stack, this is proving increasing costly as more third-party .NET libraries and tools raise their prices (there are quite a few formerly free .NET tools that have been purchased by companies and re-released as rather costly closed-source software).</p>\n<p>Second, whether or not there are licensing costs, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have more than one option for critical third-party dependencies. In the case of aspect-oriented programming on .NET, there are a number of alternatives to PostSharp. The vendor is even confident enough to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->list them on their website<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  So if licensing costs are significant enough a concern, it may be better to choose an open-source option that is less-convenient but gives you the ability to customize it than a paid option which doesn&rsquo;t (and yokes you to a specific vendor).</p>\n<p>Third, It may make sense to avoid taking on a third-party dependency altogether.  When it comes to the Microsoft stack, it&rsquo;s likely that they offer a framework or API with at least some of the capabilities you need for your solution.  In the case of AOP, Microsoft offers Unity to support those capabilities.  Especially in the case where you&rsquo;re only considering the free tier of capabilities for a third-party dependency where Microsoft offers a product, if that free tier functionality isn&rsquo;t a significant improvement, it may be best to stick with the Microsoft option.</p>\n<p> </p>\n",
				"content_text": "Last week provided our office with an inconvenient lesson in what can happen when third-party dependencies break in unanticipated ways.  PostSharp is a key third-party dependency in the line of business web application we sell.  On the morning of May 20, our continuous integration server (we use TeamCity) began indicating a build failure with the following message:\n<blockquote>\n<ul id=\"compileErrorsData\" class=\"compiler-errors\">\n\t<li class=\"compiler-error\">PostSharp.3.1.34\\tools\\PostSharp.targets(313, 5): error MSB6006: \"postsharp.4.0-x86.exe\" exited with code -199.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\nThe changed file was a Razor template file--nothing at all to do with PostSharp.  Only one person on our development team was experiencing this error on their local machine, but the end result--not being able to compile the solution locally--pretty much eliminated the possibility of that person being productive for the rest of the day.  As the day progressed, the CI server began showing exactly the same error in other branches--even with no changes to code.  It wasn't until the next day that we received <a href=\"http://www.postsharp.net/blog/post/URGENT-ACTION-REQUIRED-Critical-Defect-in-PostSharp-31-process-exits-with-code-199\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the explanation</a> (and a resolution).\n\nReading the entire explanation is worthwhile, but the key reason for the failure is this:\n<blockquote><span style=\"color: #202323;\">\"we ... assumed that all failures would be in the form of a managed exceptions. We did not anticipate that the library would terminate the process.\"</span></blockquote>\nThe fail-safe code that PostSharp implemented around a third-party licensing component assumed all failures would be managed exceptions (which they could catch and deal with accordingly).  Instead, this third-party component simply terminated the process.  The end result--any of their customers using the latest version of PostSharp couldn't compile any solution that included it.  There's no way of knowing for sure how many hours of productivity (and money) was lost as a result of this component, but the amounts were probably significant.  To his credit, the CEO apologized, his development team removed the offending dependency and sacrificed the feature which depended on it.\n\nThere are many lessons to be learned (or re-learned) from what we experienced with PostSharp, but I'll talk about three.  First, if a third-party dependency is critical to your application and has a licensing option that includes support, it is best to pay the money so that you have recourse if and when there's an issue.  On the Microsoft stack, this is proving increasing costly as more third-party .NET libraries and tools raise their prices (there are quite a few formerly free .NET tools that have been purchased by companies and re-released as rather costly closed-source software).\n\nSecond, whether or not there are licensing costs, it's a good idea to have more than one option for critical third-party dependencies. In the case of aspect-oriented programming on .NET, there are a number of alternatives to PostSharp. The vendor is even confident enough to <a href=\"http://www.postsharp.net/alternatives\">list them on their website</a>.  So if licensing costs are significant enough a concern, it may be better to choose an open-source option that is less-convenient but gives you the ability to customize it than a paid option which doesn't (and yokes you to a specific vendor).  \n\nThird, It may make sense to avoid taking on a third-party dependency altogether.  When it comes to the Microsoft stack, it's likely that they offer a framework or API with at least some of the capabilities you need for your solution.  In the case of AOP, Microsoft offers Unity to support those capabilities.  Especially in the case where you're only considering the free tier of capabilities for a third-party dependency where Microsoft offers a product, if that free tier functionality isn't a significant improvement, it may be best to stick with the Microsoft option.\n\n \n",

				"content_html": "<p>Last night, I gave a talk at Towson University to a section of software engineering students (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->a friend of mine is their professor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  The goal of the talk was to share advice and experiences that would help them in their careers.  What follows is the notes I spoke from, with revised and extended remarks (indicated by [extra]).</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overview<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Imagine being paid to test drive a car for 12 weeks.  That’s what an internship is—the only opportunity you may have in your working life to take a job and a company for a 12-week test drive.  You’ll get to see if you like the day-to-day of your particular role.  You’ll get to see if you like your boss, your co-workers, the culture of the organization.  When you are choosing your first real job, they can be a very useful filtering mechanism to determine which companies you should consider seriously and which ones you should skip.  If an internship works out really well, that company could give you your first full-time job.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If at all possible, don’t graduate without one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  A successful internship puts you ahead of recent college graduates without one because you have proof that you can do real work.</p>\n<p>Internships are also a great opportunity to begin to build networks beyond your classmates.  Even if you’re a natural introvert, make an effort to be social.  You never know when a friendship might result in a reference, an interview, or a job—for you, or a friend you make.</p>\n<p>I was an intern at The Washington Post the summer before I graduated from Maryland.  Halfway through the summer, they asked if I could return in the fall as a part-time employee and I accepted.  At the end of the year, the Post made an full-time offer for a help desk position.  I got better offers and took one of those instead, but I have no doubt it would have been much harder without that internship and part-time experience.</p>\n<p>[extra] I said during the talk that all other factors being equal, the candidate with an internship wins over the candidate without one.  To be more complete, I should have said that a candidate with a lower GPA and an internship can and does beat a candidate with a higher GPA and no internship.  My undergraduate GPA was just shy of 3.0.  But because I had a successful internship, 4 months of part-time work experience at the same company, and a great reference from my boss, I had multiple offers before graduation.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interviews<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>When it comes to interviews, expect to be asked about anything and everything on your resume.  So if you can&rsquo;t back it up in an interview, don&rsquo;t put it on your resume.  I interview people for jobs on a regular basis, and always ask questions to find out if they really know all the things their resume claims.  If you have an internship under your belt, you’ll have real work experience to put on that resume.</p>\n<p>Also expect to write code on the spot for a problem you’ll have had no advance notice of.  If you’re not asked to write it on a whiteboard, the interviewer may just put a laptop in front of you with an editor and wait for you to write it.  In interview situations like these, it’s very important that you verbalize what you’re thinking as you develop your solution to the problem.  If you stare at the whiteboard or the laptop for a long time without saying anything, the interviewer might think you’re stumped—even if that isn’t the case.  If you aren’t sure about some aspect of the question, it’s better to ask for clarification and be sure than to assume and be wrong.  I ask a simple LINQ problem in every interview—and nine times out of ten, the candidate gives the wrong answer because they assumed they knew what I was asking for instead of making sure.</p>\n<p>[extra] The following is a version of the LINQ question I ask in interviews:\nGiven the following:\nvar listOfNumbers = new List&lt;int&gt;{3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36};</p>\n<p>write the LINQ statement that returns every number in the list divisible by 12 and by 6.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Software engineering involves a lot of collaboration.  In my role, in order to develop a single feature or piece of functionality, there could be a handful of other people involved:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We’d all love to work on brand-new software, but most of us won’t get the chance.  It is highly likely that the first work you do will be maintenance of and/or enhancements to an existing system.  So developing an ability to find bugs in software (whether you originally wrote it or not) will be important to your success as a software engineer.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beyond Work<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Keep in touch, keep learning, keep your skills sharp (and add new ones).  That&rsquo;s a basic summary of the steps you need to take to go further in your career as a software engineer.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to overestimate the importance of networking to your career (and I don’t just mean having a huge number of Facebook friends, Twitter followers, or LinkedIn connections).  By networking I mean staying in regular touch with people you’ve worked with in the past or know from school that you’ve enjoyed working with (and would like to work with again).  If you’re in the same geographical area, catch up with them in person once a year if you can manage it.  If you don’t live in the same area, go beyond a word or two on Facebook.  Don’t be the guy or girl who only checks in when they need something.</p>\n<p>Having a strong one will not only bring you a wealth of useful advice and support when you need it, it will help you find work too.  A couple of examples from my own experience:\na. I worked with a guy named Dave at USWeb.  We worked together for a couple years before I left and the company folded.  We kept in touch off and on over the years, but hadn’t had regular contact in awhile.  Over 12 years after we actually worked together, he gets in touch because he’s looking for a job and trying to decide between two companies—the one where I currently work, and one I worked for previously.  I tell him my current company is better (not just trying to be a good company man, my former employer was terribly dysfunctional) and write up a referral for him.  He gets hired and over a year later he’s still having a great time.\nb. Two other guys I worked with at USWeb—Murali and Allen.  One was director of technology, the other a senior developer.  I kept in fairly regular touch with Allen.  So after almost four years at Ciena, I’m looking for a change.  Murali, our former boss, is program manager at a local consulting firm and wants to surround himself with good people from previous gigs.  He contacts Allen first, but Allen likes where he is and isn’t looking to make a change.  But Allen gives Murali my contact information.  I interview, I get hired, I work there a couple of years before moving on to a management role at a different company.</p>\n<p>Don’t pass up opportunities to expand your networks beyond classmates and people you’ve worked with in the past.  This area has plenty of software user groups.  They’ll have stand-alone website or be on meet up.com.  Join one.  Get to know people that regularly attend.  One of my current co-workers is someone I first met at a .NET user group in Rockville (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->RockNUG<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  A year-and-a-half later, when he got tired of commuting from Maryland to Virginia to work, we talked after a user group meeting about openings at my company.  He’s been there six months now and is doing great work for us.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Figure out how you learn best<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Some of us learn best through reading.  Some through lecture.  Some through examples.  Figure out which one of these you are and spend regular time outside of work learning however works best for you.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conferences and user groups provide great opportunities to network and learn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Smart companies use them to raise their profile and to recruit new talent.  The companies I consider the best ones in my career are the ones that sent at least some of their employees to a conference or training every year.  Even when I haven’t worked for companies that pay for employees to get training, I believe it’s important enough that I’ve paid my own way on more than one occasion for a particular conference.  I went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SXSW Interactive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> last year and met up with former co-workers I hadn’t seen in 10 years.  I met people from all over the world, as well as a few people who were literally across the parking lot from me.  Seriously!  I met a couple of programmers and a designer who work at a small firm in a building less than 100 yards away, but we had to fly over 1500 miles to meet.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogs, podcasts and screen-casts provide great learning opportunities as well.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  However you commute between home, school and work, it&rsquo;s time you could spend listening to one of the many podcasts available on technologies or software development.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Starting a blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great way to practice and improve your written communication.  I first started back in 2003, and my only purpose was to have a way to remember the process I went through to solve particular problems that I could access from wherever I wanted.  On occasion, I would get a comment or two from others on the web that helped me solve a problem I’d posted about or improved on a solution I’d come up with.  Sometimes a post has been useful to other developers than myself.  I’ve even gotten requests for help in the comments.  Once you have a blog, it also makes a handy place to publish a linkable copy of your resume.  That’s a piece of advice your professor gave me many years ago, and now   I have plenty of visibility to companies (and recruiters) without really having to bother with job boards.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Giving a talk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great way to practice and improve your verbal communication.  User groups are always looking for people to come and speak, and if there’s a technology that you know well (or want to know well), having to give a talk about it in front of an audience is one way to give yourself an incentive to research it and learn it well enough to be able to answer questions about it.  I try to give a few talks every year to one of the user groups I attend in Rockville.</p>\n<p>[extra] <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Starting a podcast <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is another option you might consider.  I listen regularly to a few podcasts by veteran software developers (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hanselminute<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.NET Rocks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc) and learn a lot that way.  But I think we would also benefit from hearing software engineers who are relatively new to the work world, or even from interns.  In addition to creating opportunities to hone both your writing and speaking skills, you&rsquo;ll get to learn about audio and production.</p>\n<p>With the amount of time you’ll spend working (and otherwise living your life), one of the habits that I&rsquo;ve personally found the most difficult to maintain is writing code regularly that isn&rsquo;t specifically for my job.  One of the benefits of school, especially in a computer science program, is courses where you have to learn multiple programming languages and produce working solutions in a relatively short period of time.  The diversity of languages is a great way to force yourself to think differently about how to solve a particular problem.  To the extent you make it a habit to learn a different programming language every year or two, the better your skills in your main programming language will become.</p>\n<p>Music, martial arts, sports and medicine are endeavors that have practice built into them.  Software engineering doesn&rsquo;t.  We usually treat our work as our practice.  You will improve more quickly as a developer if you practice designing and building software <!-- raw HTML omitted -->separately<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the work you do everyday.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Practice!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  There are plenty of sites out there with different code katas (small problems that you write code to solve).  Larger, longer-term side projects are also a great idea—especially if they’re tied to a hobby or something else that interests you outside of your job.  In addition to these, the web is full of open source projects that could use contributors (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->github<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->codeplex<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sourceforge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc).  Try to contribute however you can—even if it’s documentation—and you’ll benefit from the experience.</p>\n<p>[extra] When it comes to practice in improving your software engineering skills, it works best if you consistently increase the level of difficulty.  John Sonmez explains why <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  He also links to an incredible example by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jennifer Dewalt<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Programming contests (including things like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TopCoder<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) may be worth your consideration.</p>\n",

Because there was far more than 30 minutes worth of material to discuss, the rest of this post will cover material I didn't get to, commentary from the audience, and the answer to a question about tags.\n\nIn discussing the term package manager, I indicated that it meant more than one thing:\n<ul>\n\t<li>automation of dependency management for operating systems (think Unix or Linux distributions)</li>\n\t<li>automation of dependency management for programming languages (think Perl's CPAN, Ruby Gems, Node.js npm)</li>\n</ul>\nNuGet is the second type.  I find Chocolatey quite interesting because it's a package manager of the first type that leverages the capabilities of NuGet to accomplish its work.\n\nNuGet enables us as developers to define and re-define what a third-party dependency is.  The team at <a href=\"http://www.fortigent.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fortigent</a> (one of RockNUG's sponsors) has made packages out of some of the functionality they've developed internally.\n\nThere are a couple of different ways to create packages:\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/using-a-gui-to-build-packages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Package Explorer GUI</a></li>\n\t<li>\n<a href=\"http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/Creating-and-Publishing-a-Package\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nuget.exe</a> command-line tool</li>\n</ul>\nThe second way is recommended for integration with build systems.  Typing \"nuget spec\" in the location of the csproj file you want to make a package out of will generate a \"nuspec\" file (in addition to automatically referencing other files as dependencies).  Edit this file in order to add tags, licensing, links and other information you want to make available in your package.  Typing \"nuget pack\" followed by the csproj file will generate a file with the .nupkg extension.  The extension merely hides the fact that it's a ZIP file with some additional information.\n\nIn addition to creating packages, NuGet gives us the ability to set up our own package feeds.  The feed can be a simple as a network share with packages in it.  One step up from that is to create an empty ASP.NET Web application and add NuGet.Server to it.  This will add everything to the application needed to host your own packages (or others from third parties).  You can even publish your packages to this type of application if you wish.  The pinnacle of NuGet package distribution is to host your own fork of the NuGet Gallery (available on <a href=\"https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>).  One software vendor, JetBrains, <a href=\"http://resharper-plugins.jetbrains.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forked the NuGet Gallery</a> to publish documentation on all the plug-ins available for the latest version of ReSharper as well as make it possible to download ReSharper itself.  Chocolatey uses the NuGet Gallery code in a similar way.  Unlike the ReSharper gallery (which doesn't let you download plugins), the Chocolatey gallery does allow it (though the actual installs require command-line interaction, which is helpfully displayed next to each package).\n\nOne of the NuGet-related projects I found particularly interesting is <a href=\"http://concierge.nuget.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">concierge.nuget.org</a>.  Its objective is to recommend NuGet packages in the same way we receive movie, music and product recommendations from Netflix, Spotify or Amazon.  Simply upload the packages.config file for your project and get recommendations back.  I learned about this (and other .NET development-related topics) on <a href=\"http://blog.cwa.me.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Morning Brew</a>.\n\n<strong>Q &amp; A</strong>\n\nWhile there weren't any questions at the end, there was one asked during the presentation about the \"tags\" element of the nuspec file inside each package.  When you look at a package in the <a href=\"http://www.nuget.org/\">NuGet Gallery</a> (like <a href=\"http://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EntityFramework</a> for example), you see a list of linkable tags.  Clicking on one actually triggers a search for each package that shares a particular tag.  So if  you're a package author who wants their package to be discovered more easily, putting the right keywords in the \"tags\" element will help.\n",

Last year?\"\n\nThe things that previous commenters have suggested are great ideas for continuous improvement and refinement of your skills in programming.  Do as many of those things as you can.  Beyond those, I'd suggest the following:</blockquote>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Be willing to learn from anyone.</i>  I've made my living writing software since 1996 and I regularly learn new things about my craft from people a decade or more younger than me.</blockquote>\n</li>\n\t<li>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Keep track of what you learn--and share it.</i>  Whether it's through blogging, Stack Overflow contributions, or something else--write about it.  You may not encounter the exact problems you've solved in the future, but they will often be close enough that what you've captured will help you solve them much faster than you would have otherwise.  The ability to explain what you know to others is a very valuable and rare one.  The process of preparing to give a presentation to others on a topic has often been a good forcing function for me to learn that topic to the level where I can explain it well.</blockquote>\n</li>\n\t<li>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Learn about subjects beyond programming.</i>  The importance of the ability to understand new domains well enough and deeply enough to design and implement useful software for them cannot be overstated.  I've delivered software solutions for news organizations, healthcare companies, marketing companies and defense/intelligence contractors in my career so far.  Making myself familiar with the sort of terminology they use and the way such companies operate (above and beyond a specific project) definitely results in a better end product.  One or more such topics can end up being great fodder for pet projects (which are great vehicles for learning things you aren't already learning in a job).</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

It even sparked a conversation (as much of one as you can have 140 characters at a time) between me and my old co-worker Jon who agreed with Jeff Atwood in far blunter terms: &ldquo;we need to cleanse the dev pool, not expand and muddy the water&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>While I understand Jon&rsquo;s sentiment, &ldquo;cleansing&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;expanding&rdquo; just isn&rsquo;t going to happen.      Computer science as an academic discipline didn&rsquo;t even exist until the 1950s, so it&rsquo;s a very long way from having the sort of regulations and licensure of a field like engineering (a term that dates back to the 14th century). Combine that with the decreasing number of computer science graduates our colleges and universities graduate each year (much less the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->elimination of a computer science department<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), and it&rsquo;s no surprise that people without formal education in computer science are getting paid to develop software.</p>\n<p>While it does sound crazy that Mayor Bloomberg made learning to code his 2012 new year&rsquo;s resolution, I&rsquo;m glad someone as high-profile as the mayor of New York is talking about programming. When I was deciding what to study in college (way back in 1992), computer science as a discipline didn&rsquo;t have a very high profile.  While I knew programming was how video-games and other software was made, I had to find out about computer science from Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.</p>\n<p>Jeff&rsquo;s &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t learn to code&rdquo; is counterproductive&ndash;the exact opposite of what we should be saying.

				"content_text": "I came across <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this post</a> from Jeff Atwood in my Twitter feed this morning.  It even sparked a conversation (as much of one as you can have 140 characters at a time) between me and my old co-worker Jon who agreed with Jeff Atwood in far blunter terms: \"we need to cleanse the dev pool, not expand and muddy the water\".\n\nWhile I understand Jon's sentiment, \"cleansing\" vs. \"expanding\" just isn't going to happen.      Computer science as an academic discipline didn't even exist until the 1950s, so it's a very long way from having the sort of regulations and licensure of a field like engineering (a term that dates back to the 14th century). Combine that with the decreasing number of computer science graduates our colleges and universities graduate each year (much less the <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/university-florida-cuts-computer-science-department-students-fight-161100232--finance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">elimination of a computer science department</a>), and it's no surprise that people without formal education in computer science are getting paid to develop software.\n\nWhile it does sound crazy that Mayor Bloomberg made learning to code his 2012 new year's resolution, I'm glad someone as high-profile as the mayor of New York is talking about programming. When I was deciding what to study in college (way back in 1992), computer science as a discipline didn't have a very high profile.  While I knew programming was how video-games and other software was made, I had to find out about computer science from Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. \n\nJeff's \"please don't learn to code\" is counterproductive--the exact opposite of what we should be saying.  Given a choice between having more people going into investment banking and more people going into software development, I suspect a large majority of us would favor the latter.  \n\nI also don't believe that the objective of learning to code has to be making a living as a software developer in order to be useful. The folks at <a href=\"http://software-carpentry.org/\">Software Carpentry</a> are teaching programming to scientists to help them in their research.

Having to present on a tool or technology to group has always been a great incentive to do some deep learning of a subject.  It's also a chance to exercise some speaking skills (which developers need a lot more than they might think in order to be successful) and to handle a Q &amp; A session.  I haven't developed any new presentations yet, but some prospective topics include: <a href=\"http://www.linqpad.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LINQPad</a>, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/elmah/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">elmah</a>,</li>\n\t<li>Take more online training. We have access to <a href=\"http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pluralsight .NET training</a> through work.  I watched quite a few of their videos over the course of the year.  2012 shouldn't be any different in that respect.  I recently came across <a href=\"http://www.develop.com/webcasts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free webcasts</a> on a variety of topics from DevelopMentor.  Since they're downloadable as well as streamable, I'll definitely use my commute to watch some of them.</li>\n\t<li>Write a compiler. It's been awhile since I've cracked open \"the dragon book\", so I'm probably overdue to exercise my brain in that way.  I found <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc136756.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">that suggestion</a> (and a number of other very useful ones) <a href=\"http://secretgeek.net/6min_program.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Practice.  I'd heard of the \"code kata\" idea before, but hadn't really explored it.  Dave Thomas of Pragmatic Programmers has nearly a couple dozen <a href=\"http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_backg.html#more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n",

				"content_text": "I gave a presentation on .NET Reflector at the January 12 meeting of <a href=\"http://rocknug.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RockNUG</a>.  I took most of my time demonstrating the product and answering questions, so I had very few slides.  So instead of simply posting them here and calling it a day, this blog post will incorporate some of the Q &amp; A that happened during the presentation.\n\n<strong>What Is It?</strong>\n\nThe title slide in my presentation called .NET Reflector an \"x-ray machine for (unobfuscated) .NET assemblies\".  That little phrase actually understates what .NET Reflector can do.  Decompiling .NET assemblies is only one of the three major things it does (and is probably the best-publicized of its capabilities).  This tool also provides an excellent class browser and static analysis capabilities.\n\n<strong>Why Is It Helpful?</strong>\n\nIn addition to giving developers to see code for third-party assemblies when they don't have access to their source files, it can be quite a useful learning tool for seeing what the compiler generates on-the-fly for the source code we write ourselves.\n\n<strong>Demos</strong>\n\nOne of the first features I demonstrated was the ability of .NET Reflector to decompile an assembly into multiple .NET languages.  C# is the default, but VB.NET, Delphi, Oxygene, MC++, F#, and MSIL are the other target languages available out of the box.  Using the add-in architecture of .NET Reflector, one developer added limited support for <a href=\"http://reflectoraddins.codeplex.com/releases/view/1805\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">decompilation to PowerShell</a> (download the PowerShellLanguage.zip file).\n\nAround this point in the presentation, someone asked if you could cut-and-paste decompiled source into a file.  Not only does it work, but with <a href=\"http://www.denisbauer.com/NETTools.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Denis Bauer's Reflector FileDissassembler plug-in</a> installed, you can decompile an entire assembly into its constituent source code files (though I suspect that Red Gate Software would prefer that you pay for .NET Reflector Pro to get this capability). \n\nI was also able to demonstrate the much-overlooked static analysis capabilities of .NET Reflector.  They enable developers to learn what code depends on particular methods, where they're used, what code exposes them, and where they're called.  It turns out that there's a free plug-in which extends this capability even further.  The <a href=\"http://tcdev.free.fr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) plug-in</a> allows developers to generate and manipulate matrices for determining the level of complexity in a software architecture.  Considering that a full-featured tool with DSM capability like <a href=\"http://www.ndepend.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NDepend</a> costs hundreds of dollars per seat license, even a fraction of those features from a free .NET Reflector plug-in are well worth the time to learn how to leverage.\n\n<strong>More Q &amp; A</strong>\n\nWhen I showed that .NET Reflector pulled in source code comments in its display of disassembled code, one member of the audience pointed out (correctly) that this was only possible because the XML file containing the comments was co-located with the assembly.  When I tested the disassembly capability afterwards without the XML file present, the comments didn't display.\n\nThere was also a question from the audience about how .NET Reflector compared with ILDASM (which ships with the .NET Framework).  The short answer is that ILDASM is far more limited by comparison.  It only decompiles to IL, it lacks the analysis capabilities of .NET Reflector, and most importantly it doesn't have a plug-in architecture to enable expansion of what it can do.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n\nMy presentation on January 12 only scratched the surface of what .NET Reflector can do.  I hope this post has added more depth, and piqued your curiosity to use the tool to improve your own development experience.  You may find the following links helpful in leveraging .NET Reflector for your own development work:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Red Gate (<a href=\"http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/\">http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Wikipedia (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Reflector\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Reflector</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Stackoverflow (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/408167/examples-of-using-net-reflector\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/408167/examples-of-using-net-reflector</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Codeplex (<a href=\"http://reflectoraddins.codeplex.com/\">http://reflectoraddins.codeplex.com/</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Oxygene (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygene_(programming_language))\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygene_(programming_language))</a>\n</li>\n\t<li>C# in Depth (<a href=\"http://csharpindepth.com/Downloads.aspx\">http://csharpindepth.com/Downloads.aspx</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Jon Skeet (<a href=\"http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/Default.aspx\">http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/Default.aspx</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Snippy Reflector Add-In (<a href=\"http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2008/11/23/the-snippy-reflector-add-in.aspx\">http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2008/11/23/the-snippy-reflector-add-in.aspx</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n",

person, this conference was a bargain.  Given the diversity of topics and caliber of speakers, the price could have been higher and the venue would still have sold out.  Of the seven official topics presented (there was an eighth on Agile after the conference ended), only the ASP.NET MVC talk used technology that I had hands-on production experience with.  I was disappointed not to see a presentation on Android, but that was the only thing obviously missing from the day.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Keynote: Joel Spolsky<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nIf I were to boil down Joel Spolsky’s keynote to a single phrase, it would be this:</p>\n<p>“Death to the dialog box!”</p>\n<p>Spolsky’s talk argued persuasively that software often forces users to make decisions about things they don’t care about, or don’t know enough about to answer correctly.  Among his examples were modal dialog boxes for products like QuickBooks and Internet Explorer, and the Windows Vista Start button.  He talked about the other extreme (overly simple applications) as well, using the “build less” design philosophy of the 37signals team as an example.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[4]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Equating those kinds of applications with Notepad was a reach (and clearly played for laughs), but described the limitations of the alternative to complex applications pretty well.  The examples did a good job of setting up the choice between simplicity and power.</p>\n<p>He cited an experiment in the selection of jam from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[5]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to show the potential drawbacks of too many choices.  When the results of this experiment showed that a display with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fewer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> choices resulted in an order of magnitude <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sales of jam, it put a monetary value on the design decision to limit choices.</p>\n<p>Predictably, his examples of the right kind of design were products from Apple.  It takes a lot more effort to put a Nokia E71 in vibrate mode than it does an iPhone.  Spolsky pointed to the iPod’s lack of buttons for Stop and Power as examples of addition by subtraction.  The best example he chose was actually Amazon’s 1-Click shipping.  In addition to offering the most reasoned defense I’ve heard yet of Amazon winning that patent, he explained how it works for multiple purchases.</p>\n<p>A few other takeaways from the Spolsky’s keynote that I’ve tried to capture as close to verbatim as possible are:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>One of the most useful parts of the talk was about the approval process.  He gave his own experience of getting applications through the submission process, including one that was rejected and the reasons why.  According to him, 2 weeks is average time it takes Apple to accept or reject an application.  It’s even possible for upgrades of a previously-accepted app to be rejected.</p>\n<p>Pilone did a good job of making it clear that quality is what sells applications.  He used the Convert<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[6]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> application (from taptaptap) as an example.  It’s just one of over 80 unit converter applications in the App Store, but it’s beating the competition handily.  OmniFocus was his second example.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Revenue Models<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>His recommendation for selling apps in the App Store is to release a paid version first, then an ad-supported version.  This advice seemed counterintuitive to me, but I suspect he suggested it because there’s no data on the in-app upgrades revenue model.  I see in-app upgrades as Apple’s most explicit support for the “freemium”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[9]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> business model yet.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ASP.NET MVC: Scott Allen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nThis talk was basically a demo of a preview version of ASP.NET MVC 2.  Allen wrote code for his demonstration on-the-fly (with the sort of mistakes that can happen using this approach), so the example was pretty basic.  The takeaways I thought were useful for getting started with the technology were:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FogBugz and Kiln<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nEven though this was strictly a product pitch, I’ve included it in the report because of how they implement a couple of ideas: plug-in architecture and tagging.</p>\n<p>Plug-in architectures as an idea aren’t new—what was different was the motivation Joel Spolsky described for it.  One of his intentions was to make it easier for people to extend the functionality of FogBugz in ways he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->didn’t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> want.  He isn’t a fan of custom fields, so instead of building them into the core product, they’re implemented as a plug-in.  He demonstrated Balsamiq integration (via plug-in) as well, so the architecture does enable extension in ways he likes as well.</p>\n<p>Tagging isn’t a new idea either—what I found very interesting is how they apply them in FogBugz.  Spolsky pitched them as a substitute for custom workflow.  His idea (as I understood it) was that bugs could be tagged with any items or statuses outside the standard workflow.  There wasn’t much more detail than this, but I think the idea definitely is worth exploring further.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Python: Bruce Eckel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nHis talk was supposed to be about Python, but Bruce Eckel covered a lot more than that.  The most important takeaways of his talk were these:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Here’s Eckel’s hierarchy of programming languages:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Another one of his pronouncements that stood out was a hope that Java would become the COBOL of the 21<!-- raw HTML omitted -->st<!-- raw HTML omitted --> century.</p>\n<p>Eckel’s argument regarding the difficulty of writing good multithreaded code is one I’ve heard before.  He pointed to Python as a language with libraries for handling both the single processor task-switching and multi-processor parallel execution models of concurrency.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google App Engine: Jonathan Blocksom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nJonathan Blocksom gave a great overview of Google App Engine.  He’s a member of Google’s Public Sector Project Team (not the App Engine team), and I think that helped him present the information from more of an audience perspective.  He did a nice job of describing the architecture and the advantages of using it.  Some of the applications running on Google App Engine include:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[2]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Ibid</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[3]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Ibid</p>\n<p><!-- raw

supports to not do at least a little advertising.  Spolsky also attempted to divide the venue by area for networking around certain topics, but I’m not sure how successful that was.\n\nThe conference succeeded in its main objectives.  At $99 per person, this conference was a bargain.  Given the diversity of topics and caliber of speakers, the price could have been higher and the venue would still

care about, or don’t know enough about to answer correctly.  Among his examples were modal dialog boxes for products like QuickBooks and Internet Explorer, and the Windows Vista Start button.  He talked about the other extreme (overly simple applications) as well, using the “build less” design philosophy of the 37signals team as an example.<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a> Equating those kinds of applications with Notepad was a reach (and clearly played for laughs), but described the limitations of the alternative to complex applications pretty well.  The examples did a good job of setting up the choice between simplicity and power.\n\nHe cited an experiment in the selection of jam from <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less</span><a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]</a> to show the potential drawbacks of too many choices.  When the results of this experiment showed that a display with <strong>fewer</strong> choices resulted in an order of magnitude <strong>more</strong> sales of jam, it put a monetary value on the design decision to limit choices.\n\nPredictably, his examples of the right kind of design were products from Apple.  It takes a lot more effort to put a Nokia E71 in vibrate mode than it does an iPhone.  Spolsky pointed to the iPod’s lack of buttons for Stop and Power as examples of addition by subtraction.  The best example he chose was actually Amazon’s 1-Click shipping.  In addition to offering the most reasoned defense I’ve heard yet of Amazon winning that patent, he explained how it works for multiple purchases.\n\nA few other takeaways from the Spolsky’s keynote that I’ve tried to capture as close to verbatim as possible are:\n<ul>\n\t<li>The computer shouldn’t set the agenda.</li>\n\t<li>Bad features interrupt users.</li>\n\t<li>Don’t give users choices they don’t care about.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>iPhone Development: Dan Pilone</strong>\nThis talk successfully combined technical depth on iPhone development with information about business models for actually selling an app once it’s complete.  Pilone discussed which design patterns to use (MVC, DataSource, Delegate) as well as what paid applications are selling for in the App Store (the highest-grossing ones sell for between $4.99 and $9.99).\n\nOne of the most useful parts of the talk was about the approval process.  He gave his own experience of getting applications through the submission process, including one that was rejected and the reasons why.  According to him, 2 weeks is average time it takes Apple to accept or reject an application.  It’s even possible for upgrades of a previously-accepted app to be rejected.\n\nPilone did a good job of making it clear that quality is what sells applications.  He used the Convert<a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]</a> application (from taptaptap) as an example.  It’s just one of over 80 unit converter applications in the App Store, but it’s beating the competition handily.  OmniFocus was his second example.\n<em>Revenue Models</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Ad-supported (very difficult to make money with these)</li>\n\t<li>Paid</li>\n\t<li>In-app upgrades<a href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\nDan Pilone is the co-author of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Head First iPhone Development<a href=\"#_ftn8\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[8]</span></a></span>, which will be available for sale on October 29.\n\nHis recommendation for selling apps in the App Store is to release a paid version first, then an ad-supported version.  This advice seemed counterintuitive to me, but I suspect he suggested it because there’s no data on the in-app upgrades revenue model.  I see in-app upgrades as Apple’s most explicit support for the “freemium”<a href=\"#_ftn9\">[9]</a> business model yet.\n\n<strong>ASP.NET MVC: Scott Allen</strong>\nThis talk was basically a demo of a preview version of ASP.NET MVC 2.  Allen wrote code for his demonstration on-the-fly (with the sort of mistakes that can happen using this approach), so the example was pretty basic.  The takeaways I thought were useful for getting started with the technology were:\n<ul>\n\t<li>External projects that add features to ASP.NET MVC\n<ul>\n\t<li>MVCContrib</li>\n\t<li>MVC T4</li>\n\t<li>You can combine standard WebForms and MVC in the same solution—particularly useful if you’re trying to migrate an application from ASP.NET to ASP.NET MVC.  Allen mentioned the blogging platform Subtext<a href=\"#_ftn10\">[10]</a> as an example of one application attempting this kind of migration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThis talk left a lot to be desired.  StackOverflow is the most robust example of what can be built with ASP.NET MVC.  A peek inside even a small part of actual StackOverflow source using ASP.NET MVC would have made a far more compelling presentation.\n\n<strong>FogBugz and Kiln</strong>\nEven though this was strictly a product pitch, I’ve included it in the report because of how they implement a couple of ideas: plug-in architecture and tagging.\n\nPlug-in architectures as an idea aren’t new—what was different was the motivation Joel Spolsky described for it.  One of his intentions was to make it easier for people to extend the functionality of FogBugz in ways he <strong>didn’t</strong> want.  He isn’t a fan of custom fields, so instead of building them into the core product, they’re implemented as a plug-in.  He demonstrated Balsamiq integration (via plug-in) as well, so the architecture does enable extension in ways he likes as well.\n\nTagging isn’t a new idea either—what I found very interesting is how they apply them in FogBugz.  Spolsky pitched them as a substitute for custom workflow.  His idea (as I understood it) was that bugs could be tagged with any items or statuses outside the standard workflow.  There wasn’t much more detail than this, but I think the idea definitely is worth exploring further.\n\n<strong>Python: Bruce Eckel</strong>\nHis talk was supposed to be about Python, but Bruce Eckel covered a lot more than that.  The most important takeaways of his talk were these:\n<ol>\n\t<li>In language design, maintaining backward compatibility can cripple a language.</li>\n\t<li>The best programming languages change for the better by not being afraid of breaking backward compatibility.</li>\n\t<li>“Threads are unsustainable.”</li>\n</ol>\nEckel’s talk gave the audience a history of programming languages, as well as a hierarchy of “language goodness”.  For the main languages created after C, the primary motivation for creating them was to fix the problems of its predecessor.  So C++ was an attempt to fix the problems of C, while Java was an attempt to fix C++.  His assertion about the primary motivation behind Ruby was this (I’m paraphrasing):\n<blockquote>Ruby intends to combine the best of Smalltalk and the best of Perl.</blockquote>\nHe made his point about the problems of backward compatibility by comparing an attempt to add closures to Java to language changes made by Ruby and Python.  An article titled “Seeking the Joy in Java” goes into greater detail on the Java side of things.<a href=\"#_ftn11\">[11]</a> In the case of Java, the desire to maintain backward compatibility often prevents changes to a language which could fix things that are poorly implemented.  The authors of Python and Ruby aren’t afraid to break backward compatibility to make improvements, which makes them better languages than Java (in Eckel’s view).\n\nHere’s Eckel’s hierarchy of programming languages:\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"289\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Python (his favorite)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"289\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Ruby, Scala, Groovy (languages he also likes)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"289\" valign=\"top\"><strong>Java</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"289\" valign=\"top\"><strong>C++</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"289\" valign=\"top\"><strong>C</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nEckel also mentioned <a href=\"http://grails.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grails</a> as a framework he likes.\n\nAnother one of his pronouncements that stood out was a hope that Java would become the COBOL of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.\n\nEckel’s argument regarding the difficulty of writing good multithreaded code is one I’ve heard before.  He pointed to Python as a language with libraries for handling both the single processor task-switching and multi-processor parallel execution models of concurrency.\n\n<strong>Google App Engine: Jonathan Blocksom</strong>\nJonathan Blocksom gave a great overview of Google App Engine.  He’s a member of Google’s Public Sector Project Team (not the App Engine team), and I think that helped him present the information from more of an audience perspective.  He did a nice job of describing the architecture and the advantages of using it.  Some of the applications running on Google App Engine include:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Moderator (<a href=\"http://moderator.appspot.com/\">http://moderator.appspot.com/</a>)\n<ul>\n\t<li>Used by the White House to handle questions for a March 2009 town hall.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\t<li>All for Good (<a href=\"http://www.allforgood.org/\">http://www.allforgood.org/</a>)\n<ul>\n\t<li>Source code for this is available

(a 3<sup>rd</sup>-party Facebook application)</li>\n</ul>\nBlocksom also discussed some of the limitations of App Engine:\n<ul>\n\t<li>30-second time limit on asynchronous tasks</li>\n\t<li>No full text search</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>jQuery: Richard D. Worth</strong>\nThis may not have been the best talk for those already familiar with jQuery, but for me (someone unfamiliar with jQuery), it was close to perfect.  The presenter did an excellent job of showing its advantages over regular ECMAScript.  He used a clever trick to minimize the amount of typing during his demos by using slides with only the changed lines highlighted.  The “find things then do stuff” model he explained made it very easy to grasp what he was doing as he increased the complexity of his examples.<a href=\"#_ftn12\">[12]</a>\n<h3>Wrap-up</h3>\nAfter the conference ended, a “metaStackOverflow” question was added to collect reviews of the conference from its attendees.<a href=\"#_ftn13\">[13]</a> The top answer (as of October 28, 2009) also includes links to slides for three of the talks, which I’ve included here:\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://odetocode.com/downloads/devdays2.pdf\">http://odetocode.com/downloads/devdays2.pdf</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/rdworth/jquery-2366236\">http://www.slideshare.net/rdworth/jquery-2366236</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/davetron5000/measuring-agile-process-shorter-2359457\">http://www.slideshare.net/davetron5000/measuring-agile-process-shorter-2359457</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr size=\"1\"><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> [blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/s...](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-developer-days-conference/)\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Ibid\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref3\">[3]</a> Ibid\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref4\">[4]</a> [gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php)\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref5\">[5]</a> [www.amazon.com/gp/produc...](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060005688)\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref6\">[6]</a> [taptaptap.com](http://taptaptap.com/#convert)\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref7\">[7]</a> This revenue model is brand-new—Apple only began to support this within the past week or so.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref8\">[8]</a> [www.amazon.com/Head-Firs...](http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-iPhone-Development-Applications/dp/0596803540)\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref9\">[9]</a> [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium)\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref10\">[10]</a> [www.subtextproject.com](http://www.subtextproject.com/)\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref11\">[11]</a> [www.artima.com/weblogs/v...](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=173229)\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref12\">[12]</a> Worth used <a href=\"http://jsbin.com/\">http://jsbin.com/</a> for some of the more complex demos.  It’s a very good tool I hadn’t seen before.\n\n<a href=\"#_ftnref13\">[13]</a> [meta.stackoverflow.com/questions...](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/27367/devdays-reviews-washington-dc/27377#27377)\n",

Since Depew had no IT project management experience, putting him in charge of a project so large with such high stakes struck me as a mistake.  This error was compounded by having him play the role of customer advocate as well.  In order to play of the role of project manager effectively, you can't be on a particular side.

But they lacked both the necessary infrastructure and the people to make this a realistic goal.  A better approach would have prioritized the most challenging of the individual existing systems to replace (or the one with the greatest potential to boost productivity of FBI agents), and focused the efforts there.  The terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001 exposed how far behind the FBI was from a technology perspective, added a ton of political pressure to hit a home run with the new system, and probably created unrealistically high expectations as well.\n\n<strong>Enterprise Architecture is Vital</strong>\n\nThis part of Goldstein's article provided an excellent definition of enterprise architecture, which I've included in full below:\n<blockquote>This blueprint describes at a high level an organization's mission and operations, how it organizes and uses technology to accomplish its tasks, and how the IT system is structured and designed to achieve those objectives.  Besides describing how an organization operates currently, the enterprise architecture also states how it wants to operate in the future, and includes a road map--a transition plan--for getting there.</blockquote>\nUnfortunately, the FBI didn't have an enterprise architecture.  This meant there was nothing guiding the decisions on what hardware and software to buy.\n\n<strong>Delivering Earlier Means Dropping Features</strong>\n\nWhen you combine ambition beyond available resources with shorter deadlines, disaster is virtual certainty.  When SAIC agreed to deliver six months earlier than initially agreed, that should have been contingent on dropping certain features.  Instead, they tried to deliver everything by having eight teams work in parallel.  This meant integration of the individual components would have to be nearly flawless--a dubious proposition at best.\n\n<strong>Projects Fail in the Requirements Phase</strong>\n\nWhen a project fails, execution is usually blamed.  The truth is that failed projects fail much earlier than that--in requirements.  Requirements failures can take many forms, including:\n<ul>\n\t<li>No written requirements</li>\n\t<li>Constantly changing requirements</li>\n\t<li>Requirements that specify \"how\" instead of \"what\"</li>\n</ul>\nThe last two items describes the VCF's requirements failure.  The 800+ page document described web pages, form button captions, and logos instead of what the system needed to do.\n\nIn addition, it appears that there wasn't a requirements traceability matrix as part of the planning documents.  The VCF as delivered in December 2003 (and rejected by the FBI), did things that there weren't requirements for.  Building what wasn't specified certainly wasted money and man-hours that could have been better spent.  I also inferred from the article that comprehensive test scenarios weren't created until after the completed system had been delivered.  That could have (and should have) happened earlier than it did.\n\n<strong>Buy or Borrow Before You Build</strong>\n\nParticularly in the face of deadline pressure, it is vital that development buy existing components (or use open source) and integrate them wherever practical instead of building everything from scratch.  While we may believe that the problem we're trying to solve is so unique that no software exists to address it, the truth is that viable software solutions exist to subsets of many of the problems we face.  SAIC building an \"an e-mail-like system\" when the FBI was already using GroupWise for e-mail was a failure in two respects.  From an opportunity cost perspective, the time this team spent re-inventing the wheel couldn't be spent working on other functionality that actually needed to be custom built.  They missed an opportunity to leverage existing functionality.\n\n<strong>Prototype for Usability Before You Build</strong>\n\nTeams that build successful web applications come up with usability prototypes before code gets written.  At previous employers (marchFIRST and Lockheed-Martin in particular), after \"comps\" of key pages in the site were done, usability testing would take place to make sure that using the system would be intuitive for the user.  Particularly in e-commerce, if a user can't understand your site, they'll go somewhere else to buy what they want.  I attribute much of Amazon's success to just how easy they make it to buy things.\n\nIn the case of the VCF, the system was 25% complete before the FBI decided they wanted \"bread crumbs\".  A usability prototype would have caught this.  What really surprises me is that this functionality was left out of the design in the first place.  I can't think of any website, whether it's one I've built or one I've used, that didn't have bread crumbs.  That seemed like a gigantic oversight to me.\n",

You may already have an existing design in place.\"</blockquote>\nThe fourth interpretation of TDD applies pretty well to what I do now whenever I inherit an application.  Writing unit tests of the middle tier(s) of the application (if none exist) has proven to be very helpful whenever I've done this.  Adding new features becomes easier, and regression testing becomes much easier.\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n",

In this environment, his conclusion that the street programmer is better than the CS graduate is wrong. The staff that have formal training consistently deliver higher-quality results when compared to the street programmers. The code they produce is easier to maintain and better-tested.</p>\n<p>Mark Tarver's definition of street programmer is the exception, not the rule, when it comes to people who write software for a living. It doesn't include the people who got into this line of work because of Internet bubble; people who did it because they saw dollar signs rather than out of a genuine interest. I believe the person who self-teaches <strong>well</strong> is quite rare indeed.</p>\n<p>I can't dispute Tarver's points about the state of computer science education. Far too many of them have been confirmed by friends of mine who are in Ph.D programs now. He's certainly right about the conservatism of CS courses too. I still remember learning Pascal in the early 90s as part of my CS curriculum.</p>\n<p>Even with the shortcomings of today's computer science departments, the degree still serves as a useful filter when trying to decide if an interview with someone is likely to be time well spent.  I've also encountered enough good programmers in my time with degrees in math or physics that I'd certainly hire them if they interview well enough.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

They definitely don't replicate functionality already provided by whatever platform they're coding against (whether it's .NET or Java).\n- <strong>A companion characteristic is that they're good integrators.</strong>  Because they use third-party components to develop solutions, they're skilled at making them play well with each other.\n- <strong>They're good at refactoring.</strong> The first version of any application is always the worst one. A good software developer refines and otherwise improves their code as they go along.\n- <strong>The companion characteristic to refactoring is unit testing.</strong> No developer can consider themselves good unless this practice is part of their everyday work. A robust set of unit tests is the first line of defense when it comes to high-quality code.</blockquote>\nThis was what I came up with off the top of my head.  I'd be curious to hear opinions from others (yes, all three of my loyal readers) on what makes a good software developer.\n",

While I don't think I'm nearly as ambitious as my friends, there are some things I've been thinking about doing that would be good to attempt this year:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Learn a new programming language</strong>.  One of the consultants that works for me has had a lot of good things to say about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eiffel.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eiffel</a>.  So far, I've installed the development environment, read a bit of documentation, and written a bit of sample code.  There's a small product idea I'd like to try, and I plan to use Eiffel to do it.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Incorporate.</strong>  My friend Richard has been encouraging me to do this for years now, instead of being a regular employee for some company.  He's been working for himself as long as I've known him (at least 12 years now) and has done very well.  So far, I've bought a couple of domain names and done enough budgeting to determine what my hourly rate should be if I were to go into IT consulting.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Re-learn the piano.</strong>  I was good enough at it when I was younger that my last piano teacher wanted me to go to school at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Institute\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Peabody Institute</a>.  Spending the past couple of years as a sound engineer for one of the services at my church just made me miss being able to play even more.  Since I can still read music, I need to do something more with it.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Study the Bible more regularly.  </strong>Some years ago, I took a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cokesbury.com/disciple_controller.aspx?pageid=204&amp;id=17\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Disciple Bible Study</a> class at my church.  We covered 75-80% of the Bible over the course of a year.  It was a very spirtually-rewarding experience.  I want to get (and keep) my life in enough balance that I can make some Bible study a part of each day.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Take a two-week vacation.  </strong>2005 was the first year I'd taken more than a week off in a row since my undergraduate days (back in the mid 90s).  I took a bus tour through western Europe for nearly two weeks with my dad (and about 50 other people) and had an excellent time.  It really helped me disconnect from work concerns, and I'm positive I'll need to do that again this year.</li>\n</ul>\n",

This is an argument I hadn't thought of.  The apps I build tend to be database-driven websites.  Testing logic that makes database calls at any point does slow things down quite a bit.

The next few paragraphs will discuss how I felt the product stacked up against \"the four questions\".\n\n<strong>1. Is open source the best choice for this application?\n</strong>Because of how long online forums have been around, open source is a particularly good choice for this application.  I came across a pretty large number of options for online forums when I was searching.  That said, a number of them were written in languages like PHP or Perl for UNIX (which helps answer question 2).\n\n<strong>2. What platform are your developers most skilled at building for?</strong>\nAs a Microsoft shop, trying to deliver a customized solution on a platform the developers weren't familiar with was far too high a risk.  This eliminated a significant number of the applications I'd seen.\n\n<strong>3. Is the best open source application on the .NET platform?</strong>\nIn 2004, I would have said no.  To me it seemed more likely that the best open source forum application would be on UNIX, simply because of longevity.  But given what the developers we had were familiar with, and the alternative of cut-and-paste inheritance with a classic ASP solution, Community Server: Forums was the best for our purposes.\n\n<strong>4. Is it our goal to re-sell an application we've extended?</strong>\nUnlike our experience with IssueTracker, the objective of making money with modified versions of this application was clear from the very beginning.\n\nThere are two \"barriers to entry\" with Community Server that proved significant in our case:\n<ul>\n\t<li>C#</li>\n\t<li>Documentation</li>\n</ul>\nWhile I had made a deliberate choice to learn C# instead of VB.NET back in 2001, the vast majority of the developers I had to work with had moved to VB.NET from VB.  The lack of familiarity with C# syntax led to a number of suboptimal choices for customizing the look, feel, and functionality of a particular instance of Community Server.  The relative lack of documentation (both in the source code and stand-alone) made it a challenging platform to extend.  I suspect that some of this is by design, as Telligent still makes some portion of their income from custom implementations of Community Server.\n\nOn the plus side, Community Server is quite well-built.  Its naming and architecture are consistent enough that it took me relatively little time to customize a version of it for my most recent project: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pushingback.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pushingback.com</a>.

According to <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1956384,00.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this article</a>,  A9's contract with Google expired and they decided to go with Microsoft for the replacement.\n\nI tried \"v for vendetta\" as a search in both <a href=\"http://a9.com/v%20for%20vendetta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A9.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2006-13%2CGGGL%3Aen&amp;q=v+for+vendetta&amp;btnG=Search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google </a>to see how the results differed (if at all).  In my case, the top 6 links from A9 were to the V for Vendetta website by Warner Brothers (hits 1-2), its IMDB entry (hits 3-4), its Wikipedia entry, and its Rotten Tomatoes review.  Google gave me the same hits, in almost the same order.  The only difference was that the top result returned showtimes for the movie close to my zip code.  A9 actually provides that info too, you just have to check the \"Movies\" option.\n\nIt looks like Microsoft's search has actually improved somewhat since I last tried it.  I'll be curious to see what moves Google and Yahoo make to try and stay top two in market share.\n\nUpdate:\n\nWhen I talked to my friend <a href=\"http://sandro.knot.org/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sandro </a>about the switch and told him what search term I used, he suggested I use a tougher search term to test the relevance of lower-level results.

				"content_text": "<em>Open source on the .NET platform is a topic I've been thinking about for awhile.  My current boss has made it a point to try and use open source applications built with .NET whenever possible.  This is the first in an occasional series of posts on the topic.\n</em>\n\nA good definition of the term \"open source\" comes from Vaskin Kissoyan of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lokion.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lokion, Inc.</a>. Here's the software developer aspect of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.opensourcemovement.org/what-is-open-source/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the full definition</a>:\n<blockquote>\"Open Source Software allows a developer to contribute to an already existing product or application, it also provides a rich set of library code (basic functionality) effectively giving you an almost unlimited amount of blocks upon which to build your applications. The OS community fosters reuse so there is no need to re-invent the wheel - a major problem for all developers before the dawn of Open Source.\"</blockquote>\nHow well does this definition apply to some of the software built using .NET since the year 2000?  In some respects, it fits quite well.  When it comes to library code, Microsoft has provided Application Blocks, then the more robust Enterprise Library.  Microsoft has also done a good job of providing reference applications as starting points for future development.  This is a practice I first took advantage of during the Windows DNA days when I used the Fitch &amp; Mather Stocks application as the basis for an online recruitment tool I built for <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ciena\" href=\"http://www.ciena.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ciena</a> in 2001.  Since that time, sample applications like Duwamish Books and a myriad of <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"ASP.NET Starter Kits\" href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/downloads/kits/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">starter kits</a> have been the basis for many custom development efforts.\n\nThe <a title=\"Issue Tracker starter kit\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.asp.net/starterkits/downloadissuetracker.aspx?tabindex=0&amp;tabid=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Issue Tracker starter kit</a> was the first open source .NET application our group at Aspen Systems (now <a title=\"Lockheed Martin IT\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lockheedmartin.com/wms/findPage.do?dsp=fec&amp;ci=13659&amp;sc=400\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lockheed Martin IT</a>) tried to use.  The group lacked a formal, centralized way of tracking bugs in the software we developed, so my manager saw it as a no-cost way to build our skill with C# (it's also available in VB.NET) and .NET and improve our development process.\n\nLooking back on the experience, we should have answered the following questions before we moved forward with the IssueTracker starter kit:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Is open source the best choice for this application (buy versus build/extend)?</li>\n\t<li>What platform are your developers most skilled at building for?</li>\n\t<li>Is the best open source application on the .NET platform?</li>\n\t<li>Is it our goal to re-sell an application we've extended?</li>\n</ol>\nAt the time, I could have gone either way on whether an open source application was the best choice for issue/bug tracking.  There are tons of commercial, closed-source options with plenty of functionality.  One such application is <a title=\"FogBugz\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FogBugz</a>.  The latest version has great e-mail integration, discussion groups, source code control integration, support for release notes, RSS and more.  It can get expensive, but selling custom software for a living should mean that we recoup those costs.\n\nEven if there was no willingness to spend money (and there wasn't) and open-source was the direction chosen, <a title=\"Bugzilla\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bugzilla.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bugzilla</a> is used by enough companies and organizations (including Id Software, NASA, and Akamai) that we should have considered it far more strongly than we did.\n\nWe were (and still are) primarily a Microsoft shop, so the developers were most familiar with that platform.

So it's rather ironic (and annoying) that I'm who he asks to write code when it looks like his project will miss its deadline.\n\nNeeding heroism on most of your projects means something is seriously wrong with the process.  It's particularly discouraging when your employer received a <a title=\"CMMI\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/cmmi.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CMMI</a> Level 2 certification within the past six months.  That level is supposed to mean heroism is in the past.  In reality, CMMI Level 2 means a ton of documentation (and a ton of time spent writing it).  It doesn't fix inaccurate budgets estimates or timelines, clients that keep changing their minds about what they want or a lack of developers to actually build the product.\n",

In any case, it's an alternative to a dealer appraising it (since they have a vested interest in appraising it at lower than true value).  Don't reveal the appraisal value unless the dealer's offer is lower.</li>\n\t<li>Have two different cars you're willing to buy.</li>\n\t<li>Consider buying a demo car.  They'll have far less mileage than a certified pre-owned car, but will still have a price advantage over a brand-new car.  You may even get a car with more features.</li>\n</ul>\n",

There was very little use of blogging software to automate RSS feed generation.  A number of our fellow presenters talked about custom solutions on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LAMP</a> stack that retrieved content from databases.  \n\nOur <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/podcast/rss/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">podcasting solution</a> for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ONDCP</a> was the only one that used Microsoft technology.  The code we started with was a demo application including an Access database, a feed generation page, and a number of admin pages for adding, updating, and deleting RSS feed items.  Our customizations included the following:\n<ul>\n\t<li>making the application run against SQL Server instead of Access</li>\n\t<li>adding iTunes-specific tags</li>\n\t<li>XSL to transform the raw XML into something viewable by users with regular web browsers</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe solution works reasonably well, but it isn't as fully-featured as WordPress or MovableType.  LMIT will be using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://communityserver.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community Server</a> as part of the redesign of ONDCP's current blog, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pushingback.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pushingback.com</a>.  We're using version 1.1 on an extranet project I'm managing and it's got tons of feature.  I think it's overkill for a single blog, but if ONDCP decides they want forum functionality, photo galleries, blog rolling, etc, Community Server gives them all that out of the box.\n",

Block elements cannot appear inside inline elements.  Inline elements <u>can</u> appear next to each other.\n\n* The default master tag for a WebControl is <span>.  You should override the TagKey property in .NET 2.0 to change this.

Also declare a public event handler delegate.\n</li>\n<li>Events are not inheritable\n</li>\n<li>Make button controls overridable with protected virtual void methods.\n</li>\n<li>Object properties can be made read-only because their internal properties have their own getters and setters\n</li>\n<li>Save WebControl state by using an object array.  Reserve the zeroth array element for the base.SaveViewState call.\n</li>\n<li>Style isn't serializable, so it's handled slightly differently.\n</li>\n<li>Use ControlState to keep your control functioning even with ViewState turned off.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Recommended Reading</b>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201760401/104-4195588-7155105?v=glance&amp;n=283155\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Essential ASP.NET With Examples in C#</a>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201760398/104-4195588-7155105?v=glance&amp;n=283155\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Essential ASP.NET with Examples in Visual Basic .NET</a>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590591402/ref=nosim/104-4195588-7155105?camp=2025&amp;dev-t=D26XECQVNV6NDQ&amp;link%5Fcode=xm2&amp;n=283155\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Building ASP.NET Server Controls</a>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dotnetdude.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.dotnetdude.com</a>\n* Just reading good source code is great education</span>\n",

He should also get credit for increasing taxes on the highest earners in this country.  That contributed a lot to the government going from deficit to surplus.

While Clinton isn&rsquo;t the only one to blame for the genocide in Rwanda (the whole world stood by on that one), as the leader of the greatest military power in the world, his government&rsquo;s inaction was very disappointing.  Impeachment ranks as the worst of his failures from an opportunity cost perspective, not just the moral one.

				"content_text": "Trying to find some information about Bush's latest appointee to the Supreme Court, I found two comments especially troubling:\n\n<blockquote>\"The reaction of many conservatives today will be that the president has made possibly the most unqualified choice since Abe Fortas who had been the president's lawyer. The nomination of a nominee with no judicial record is a significant failure for the advisers that the White House gathered around it.  However, the president deserves the benefit of a doubt, the nominee deserves the benefit of hearings, and every nominee deserves an up or down vote.\"\n— Manuel Miranda, chairman of the conservative Third Branch Conference</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"This is a smart move. You try to pick a nominee that Democrats won't be able to criticize as much because they are a woman or minority. This is a classic Clarence Thomas strategy.\"\n\n— Artemus Ward, Northern Illinois University political science professor.</blockquote>\n\nFor other reactions, see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-100305miers_reax,0,6212487.story?coll=la-home-headlines\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full version of the article</a> (free registration required).\n\nThey are minority opinions to be sure, the bulk of the comments so far range from polite to unalloyed praise for Harriet Miers.

				"title": "Battle on Teaching Evolution Sharpens",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>I first read about the <a href=\"http://www.discovery.org/\">Discovery Institute</a> in a Wired magazine <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/evolution.html\">article</a> last October.  At the time, I considered the piece rather alarmist.  Seeing this piece in the Post months later prompted me to consider the issue more fully.  One quote from a minister in the story stands out:<br><blockquote>A prominent effort is underway in Kansas, where the state Board of Education intends to revise teaching standards. That would be progress, Southern Baptist minister Terry Fox said, because \"most people in Kansas don't think we came from monkeys.\"</blockquote><br>This is entirely the wrong reason to revise teaching standards.  Even though I'm a Christian, and have faith that God created everything, the idea that what gets taught in science class should be decided by majority rule is a disturbing one.  The intent is not to create better students, or develop their critical thinking skills, but to use political power to impose beliefs.  When Christians get into these battles over what should be taught, it seems to me that faith is left out of the equation.  For all the doubts that Terry Fox and others have about evolution, the proposition that God created heaven and earth is even more difficult to prove.  I'm not even sure that such a thing should be provable, otherwise, what need would we have for faith?  People who pursue these kinds of curriculum changes seem not to understand that science and theology have fundamentally different goals.<br><br>This quote from a mother in Wichita, Kansas was interesting:<br><blockquote>\"If students only have one thing to consider, one option, that's really more brainwashing,\" said Duckett, who sent her children to Christian schools because of her frustration. Students should be exposed to the Big Bang, evolution, intelligent design \"and, beyond that, any other belief that a kid in class has. It should all be okay.\"</blockquote><br>Beyond the feeling of some people who aren't Christians that Christian schools are a form of brainwashing, there are other problems with her statement.  Schools don't have infinite amounts of time to teach any idea that comes down the pike about the origins of life.  Our schools need to teach the things that will turn out thoughtful, functional individuals.  Teaching a bunch of other stuff chosen by popular consensus (instead of validated through a process that imposes some objective standards) simply doesn't accomplish that goal.<br><br>The passage I found most disturbing in the piece was this one:<br><blockquote>Fox -- pastor of the largest Southern Baptist church in the Midwest, drawing 6,000 worshipers a week to his Wichita church -- said the compromise is an important tactic. \"The strategy this time is not to go for the whole enchilada. We're trying to be a little more subtle,\" he said.</blockquote><br>It disappointed me that a pastor with this kind of following would openly acknowledge the intellectual dishonesty of his approach.  If he wants creationism to be taught in school, he should spend his efforts building and supporting private Christian schools that will do it.  This stealth approach of trying to force it into public schools is wrong.  Christianity should not be compulsory.<br><br>I appreciate the approach of the Christian schools my parents sent me to from elementary school through high school.  In each one, my classmates and I learned evolution in our science classes.  We had Bible classes for learning about God, creation, and other theological issues.  Before we could graduate from high school, we all had to take a course in world religions, so we wouldn't be ignorant of faith traditions outside our own.  I think that sort of division is necessary and appropriate.  Those classmates of mine who went on to graduate studies in biology and chemistry, medical school, and professional lab work or medical practice are great at what they do because of that division.  It certainly hasn't made them less Christian, or less sure of their faith.  <br><br>When I went to a public university, this kind of upbringing made me better able to share what I believe with others, made others more comfortable sharing their beliefs with me and asking me more about them.  I didn't feel any pressure to compromise what I believed in (and still believe in).  I wish more Christian schools would take that approach.<div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"></div>\n",

They're allowed to do this by the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996.<br><br>2003: Judge Richard W. Roberts awards them $653 million in compensatory damages and $306 million in punitive damages.<br><br>Soon after this, the Bush administration argues the case should be thrown out.  Why?  Reasons include: <br>--President Bush had voided such claims against Iraq because of the current occupation<br>--This Scott McClellan quote: \"These resources are required for the urgent national security needs of rebuilding Iraq.\"<br><br>When the case goes to the US Court of Appeals for the DC circuit, the 3 judges ruled unanimously for the Bush administration and throw out the lawsuit.  The case is now before the Supreme Court.</blockquote><br><br>For their sakes, I only hope that the Supreme Court has far more sense than the government on this case.<div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"></div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>Whoever reads this should take my comments with a grain of salt.  I've worked in DC on multiple occasions, but I've never been a resident.\n<br>\n<br>Local sportstalk radio yesterday was full of opinions on the last-minute requirement of the DC Council (more specifically, its chairwoman Linda Cropp) that at least half of the new stadium be privately financed.  The calls I heard were surprising balanced between for and against her actions.  The comment I found most interesting was one by a caller who compared the DC Council to the Palestinians because they \"never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity\".\n<br>\n<br>Based on what some of people on the council are saying, it seems as if some of them have forgotten who they're negotiating with.  This is the same group of owners that helped to kill the MLB playoffs in 1994.  They have the right to unilaterally contract two franchises in 2006.  The owners claim to have lost $50 million running the Expos collectively--and chose to do this rather than sell the team earlier.  So to any of those councilmen who think baseball \"doesn't have a choice\", just look at the evidence.  MLB owners have already demonstrated an ability and a willingness to cut off their nose to spite their own face.  So trying to get a better deal at the last minute had to mean you were telling baseball to take a hike.\n<br>\n<br>If <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2202-2004Dec15.html\">this article</a> is any indication, a team might not even play here in 2005 and then find another home.  They might just go somewhere else entirely.  There were five other suitors for this team besides Washington, and I'm certain they're just waiting for another chance.<div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"></div>\n",

If England or France had over 100,000 troops in this country and was fighting on the side of the North or the South, Krauthammer might have an argument.  But since that isn't what happened, it's merely a bad excuse for the disenfranchisement of \"barely 20 percent\" of Iraqi citizens.\n<br>\n<br>The one point he makes in his column that I agree with is that a civil war is already happening in Iraq.  Which is why it seems senseless to me for him to say this:\n<br><blockquote>If Iraq's Sunni Arabs--barely 20 percent of the population--decide they cannot abide giving up their 80 years of minority rule, ending with 30 years of Saddam Hussein's atrocious tyranny, then tough luck.  They forfeit their chance to shape and participate in the new Iraq.</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>This idea that Iraq will go on without the Sunnis if they don't lay down their arms and vote completely ignores the nature of the violence that has been taking place.  In the same section of the newspaper is an article about candidates for this election in Iraq being murdered.  We shouldn't forget how quickly the violence spread to other parts of Iraq after the Fallujah offensive either.\n<br>\n<br>What seems to be shaping up is another Beirut situation--US troops in the middle of a civil war.

That's right -- overwhelmingly, people harmed through medical mishaps are not compensated.</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>If the rate is anywhere near that high today, it's no wonder the system is in trouble today.  But he also provides more current information that's even more troubling:\n<br><blockquote>And a recent study by Harvard University researchers found that 80 percent of malpractice claims were filed against doctors who had made no error whatever.</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>Doctors simply can't stay in business if 8 times out of 10 that a claim is filed, they haven't done anything wrong.\n<br>\n<br>Brody's final paragraph is key:\n<br><blockquote>A few new caps on liability costs aren't going to solve the problem.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>It's easy enough to say it now, but I didn't see Kerry winning this election against George W. Bush.  Kerry held too many positions on a number of issues that made it too easy for his opponents to characterize him as indecisive.  Even though I feel the course is wrong, Bush has been steadfast in pursuing it.  I felt enough people were sufficiently scared of the prospect of another terrorist attack that Bush would win for that reason.\n<br>\n<br>In reading the press from 11/3 onward, it appears that most people who voted were motivated not by fear of terrorists, but by \"values\".  Amendments against \"gay marriage\" drew many people to the polls.  As a Christian, a Seventh-day Adventist, someone reading this might think I would be happy about that.  Instead, I am sad.  If there is anything this election confirmed for me, it is that a politician can win votes by merely paying lip service to being a Christian, particularly if they are born-again.  It seems to me that there was scant evidence of this Christian faith exercised on the trail.  For months and months we were subjected to all kinds of attacks and distortions of the opponents' records, if not by the principals, then those who work for them.  I'm still looking for the passage of scripture where it says it's acceptable to have someone speak on your behalf to lie about your opponent in a race for elected office.  Our politicians rail against \"gay marriage\" and talk about protecting the sanctity of it.  Those of us who believe in God are sadly mistaken if we believe that any government can make anything sacred.  What sense does it make to entrust governments who invented \"common law\" marriage and \"no fault\" divorce to defend marriage?  How unfortunate that a few invocations of God's name or a familiar hymn should be a substitute for competence.\n<br>\n<br>This election is another step in the sad trend toward the mixing of government and religion.  The purpose of churches is not to act as agencies of government.  Rather than spend time and money pursuing federal funds or acting as part of any \"faith-based initiative\" from the White House, those of us who believe ought to be doing what we can to share our faith.  We should have a positive impact on the communities we're a part of.  Government funds nearly always come with strings attached.  They can force church ministries to \"secularize\" their messages.  It's far better to forgo those funds and share faith openly.  Government funding of church ministries is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.\n<br>\n<br>We should see by now that politicians can't be depended on as any sort of guide for moral leadership.  I think things would be a lot better if we tried to be better examples to others in our own lives.\n<br>\n<br><div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"></div>\n",

We had a golden moment, and we let it pass. The way to lock in our gains then would have been to artificially raise the price of gasoline with a tax that would depress consumption, maintain consumer demand for fuel efficiency and, most important, direct much of the pump price into the U.S. economy (via the U.S. Treasury) rather than having it shipped to Saudi Arabia, Russia and other sundry, less than friendly places.\"</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>He details his idea further:\n<br>\n<br><blockquote>\"The idea is for the government -- through a tax -- to establish a new floor for gasoline, say $3 a gallon. If the world price were to rise above $3, the tax would be zero. What we need is anything that will act as a brake on consumption. Since America consumes 45 percent of the world's gasoline, a significant reduction here would bring down the world price.\"\n<br>\n</blockquote><blockquote>\n<br>\"But the key is to then keep the tax. Indeed, let it increase to capture all of a price reduction. Consumers still pay $3, but the Saudis keep getting lower and lower world prices. The U.S. economy keeps the rest in the form of taxes -- which should immediately be cycled back to consumers by a corresponding cut in, say, payroll or income taxes. \"</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>If people understood how much of their income was being devoured by payroll taxes, they might not mind gas prices being fixed at $3/gallon if payroll taxes dropped enough.  I know I wouldn't.  But the real puzzle is how you'd keep the Social Security and Medicare programs solvent if you cut payroll.

This paragraph in particular describes the entire problem of the war on terror:\n<br>\n<br><blockquote>The first axiom is: When there is no penalty for failure, failures proliferate. Leave aside the question of who or what failed before Sept. 11, 2001. But who lost his or her job because the president's 2003 State of the Union address gave currency to a fraud -- the story of Iraq's attempting to buy uranium in Niger? Or because the primary and only sufficient reason for waging preemptive war -- weapons of mass destruction -- was largely spurious? Or because postwar planning, from failure to anticipate the initial looting to today's insufficient force levels, has been botched? Failures are multiplying because of choices for which no one seems accountable.</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>The logical conclusion of Will's argument is that President Bush should hold Rumsfeld accountable.  Thus far, he has failed to do so.  <div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"></div>\n",

Galbraith</a> makes a compelling case for how the U.S. can extricate itself from the disaster that Iraq has become.  Along the way, he does a good job of touching on the positive aspects of this war (namely the removal of Saddam Hussein).  To sum up his solution, it is a loose confederation of three separate states, with their own governments, militaries, etc.  The only connections between them would be a relatively weak central government and revenue-sharing of oil sales (to prevent the \"Sunni triangle\", which lacks oil, from being impoverished).\n<br>While it is far from the grand Bush vision of Iraq as a democratic example for the Middle East, it would probably be far better than the current situation.<div style=\"clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"></div>\n",

After installing the driver and radio software on the PC, my machine crashed.  Every other time I tried to start up the radio software, it would reboot my machine.  So I followed the two pieces of advice I'd been given earlier:\n<br>\n<br>   1. Install the GemTek drivers instead\n<br>   2. Install Radiator\n<br>\n<br>The drivers and the software are both freely available.  Now everything works like a charm.  I've got the same FM radio presets on my PC that I've got in my car.  The really interesting feature of the software is that it allows you to schedule the recording of broadcasts in WAV or MP3 format.

Smoother data can reveal trends that \"spikey\" data can't.\n\nSide note: when sewage gets into drinking water, cholera can result. This comes from a discussion of process of stopping a cholera epidemic in London, and the way data was used to determine the source.\n\nMake small, but effective differences. This brings out more info.\n\nDefend your content against a production process that might mess it up.\n\nBorrow strong design (don't reinvent the wheel).\n\n<strong>Displaying Financial Data</strong>\n\n1. It's generally an assessment of change.\n\n2. Show averages and variation. Detail increases credibility. Clutter and confusion are design failures. Micro-macro design is a good idea.\n\n3. When comparing money &amp; time over more than a year, you must adjust for inflation so comparisons will be correct. Annual reports typically don't do this, so their data in tables &amp; graphs is wrong. Data needs to be adjusted for seasonal effects.\n\n4. Don't trust a display with no footnotes. Footnotes help credibility.\n\n5. Financial data should explain as well as describe. Annotation is a good tool for accomplishing this. Every table &amp; graphic in a presentation should be annotated.\n\n6. Find and follow great conventions of displaying financial data. Borrow strength. Don't be constrained by time or geography in your search for examples to borrow.\n\nConsider what thinking task the analytical display is supposed to help.\n\nRegression toward the mean is a statistical fact. So you must separate that from other possibilities when trying to use data to make public policy.\n\nRecency bias is the tendency of people to give more weight to the most recent data.\n\nSpark lines are a Tufte invention for displaying financial (or similar) data. They display better on paper than on a computer screen.\n\nDesign should not reproduce the hierarchy. It shouldn't reproduce bureaucracy. Don't reproduce binary searches.\n\nDesign should be as flat as possible. Should depend on scanning of reader's eye, not scrolling. Sites like GoogleNews and Yahoo and other portals are successful because they cram lots of info into the first screen.\n\nPaper is: permanent, high resolution, portable\n\n\"Users should never see an operating system.\" (Edward Tufte) On the shop floor, and in military environments, user interfaces are devoted entirely to content.\n\nScreen should be 90% content in web design. You don't need more than a nav bar to navigate a website.\n\nSide Note: Edward Tufte loves the iBook G4. The MacOS is ok, though he doesn't like the dock because it reveals the OS.\n\nMicrosoft bought a company that developed an app called Presenter in 1984. The app became PowerPoint. A software corporation is its underlying metaphor (structured, nested, hierarchical, short lines). It is presenter-oriented, not audience-oriented.\n\nPowerpoint's problem is that it's low-res. the bullet points are a big problem too.\n\nDon't abbreviate the truth to fit on a slide. Find a better presentation method.\n\nAn 11x17\" piece of paper can hold the same amount of information as 250 PowerPoint slides. Feel free to use PowerPoint to display really expensive graphics (that would be cost-prohibitive).\n\nBell Centennial is both highly readable and highly condensed. Great for use in serious printing situations.\n\nSolid rocket boosters are built in Utah, assembled in Florida. The post-manufacture assembly is what makes O-rings necessary.\n\nLessons to Learn from Challenger Disaster Presentation\n\n1. Show me causality\n\n2. Show me all relevant evidence\n\n3. Ask yourself: what do I really need to see?\n\nThese 3 things improve the chances of making the right decision. Tables should have numbers and words in them.\n\nSupporting material can be found here.\n\nTechniques for Better Presentations\n\n1. Show up early. Good for giving handouts and getting to know your audience individually.\n\n2. Problem, relevance, solution. Your presentation must have these elements.\n\n3. Never apologize in your intro.\n\n4. Particular, general, particular. This pattern can be used to present slide information (instead of just reading the slide).\n\n5. Think about your audience by what they read.\n\n6. The Gettysburg Address (what not to do)\n\n7. The audience is precious. Treat them accordingly, don't patronize. Consider them colleagues. Be civil and diplomatic, but don't self-censor.\n\n8. Humor is good. But don't be generic.\n\n9. Don't use masculine pronouns universally. Feel free to use plurals.\n\n10. Don't hide behind the podium. Believe in what you're presenting, and be demonstrative.\n\n11. Finish early.\n\nOutside the Meeting\n\n1. Practice, practice, practice\n\n2. Practice in front of a friend.\n\n3. Practice in front of a video camera (so you can pick up any habitual gestures or movements, stutters, use of the word \"um\", etc.)\n\n4. Get better presentation content.\n<div style=\"clear: both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;\"></div>\n",
