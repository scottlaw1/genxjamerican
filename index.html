			 <p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h2927t.html">Frederick Douglass’ July 5, 1852 speech</a> unfortunately feels very appropriate this 4th of July. While the subject of Douglass’ speech is the hypocrisy of celebrating an Independence Day in a nation that still practiced chattel slavery, this passage speaks loudly to the present:</p>
<p>“your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; <strong>your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence</strong>; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are … mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy &ndash; a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.”</p>
<p>Some time this afternoon, the president of the United States will sign legislation that will further shred an already-inadequate social safety net to the tune of over $1 trillion in order to fund more tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.  Some 17 million Americans are projected to lose their healthcare coverage so someone can add a new McMansion to their real estate holdings or another Gulfstream to their fleet.  The same legislation will fund the goon squad known as Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE) to a level higher than all but 15 countries on earth fund their entire military.  Some of the same people who cheered both the idea and the brutal reality of mass deportation will see the rural hospitals they depend on for healthcare shut down due to these cuts.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the DeSantis administration in Florida opened a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/07/02/lawmaker-compares-alligator-alcatraz-to-concentration-camps/84442326007/#">concentration camp in the Everglades</a> funded with money intended to help Florida recover from natural disasters like hurricanes.  Now the Trump administration no longer has to outsource its abuses of civil rights and liberties to El Salvador—they can do all that right here.  <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/nancy-mace-floats-bringing-alligator-alcatraz-to-south-carolina-gators-are-ready/">Nancy Mace of South Carolina has written to DHS to advocate for a similar domestic gulag in her state</a>.</p>
<p>The SCOTUS assault on the 14th Amendment that began with allowing an insurrectionist to stand for election last year, continued with their decision to make citizenship itself subject to the whim of the executive, rather than the plain text of the amendment or over a century of precedent. Numerous GOP politicians up to and including Trump have threatened and/or advocated for the arrest, de-naturalization, and deportation of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic Party’s nominee for mayor of New York City.</p>
<p>In mere months after his return to the White House, a country that appeared to still be subject to some notion of the rule of law even during Trump’s first term has fully transformed into one subject to the whims of Donald Trump—aided and abetted by servile congressional majorities and a Supreme Court where six Roger Taneys sit instead of just one. People documented and undocumented alike are kidnapped off the street by masked ICE agents without badges, IDs, warrants, or anything resembling accountability.  Active duty soldiers are mobilized for domestic law enforcement duties in defiance of federal law. From 2016 to the present, this country has recreated many of the worst failures of its history—resegregation of the federal government, mass deportation, xenophobic immigration policy, unprovoked military action against foreign nations, and more.  This 4th of July and those to come will not be a day to celebrate the country, but to lament how far it has fallen.</p>

			 <p>My employer first started treating Juneteenth as a company holiday back in 2020, back when we still believed we could “stop the spread” of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by police. Five years later,  Juneteenth is a federal holiday, by virtue of the single term of Joe Biden’s presidential administration and Democratic control of Congress. But as was the case in 2020, Donald Trump is president again.</p>
<p>Especially today, it is a struggle to navigate the cognitive dissonance of observing as a holiday the news of emancipation finally reaching enslaved black folks in Texas when the country’s electorate willingly shackled itself to a demonstrably corrupt and incompetent felon in 2024.  The year is not even half over and we’ve watched the re-segregation of our government, experienced and capable generals being fired because they are black, the return of the names of Confederate traitors to military bases, and many more indignities to combat “DEI”.  Many corporations, universities, and municipalities are beating as hasty a retreat from the reckoning George Floyd’s murder was supposed to bring as they did rushing to place themselves on the right side of that moment.  Even <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/06/18/us/juneteenth-cancelations-trump-dei-rollbacks">today’s Juneteenth celebrations have been much smaller</a> than in past years because of that retreat.</p>
<p>A year from now, will Juneteenth even be recognized as a federal holiday anymore?  What other anti-black backlash might we see in a country that so readily installed a criminal in the nation’s highest office and refuses to take any accountability for what they’ve done?  Historians call the period from the end of Reconstruction through the early 20th century the nadir of racial relations in the United States. But where we find ourselves today feels like we may be well into a new nadir.</p>

			 <p>Jelani Cobb&rsquo;s weekend essay, <a href="https://apple.news/Aq1Tfs6bTTSyMBLF2aW7-gg">The Old Man</a>, proved a timely and thoughtful read.  I was 41 when my twins, Elliott and Emily, were born.  I can&rsquo;t imagine starting the fatherhood journey with twins at 50 as Cobb did, though he&rsquo;d helped raise a stepdaughter previously.  Raising twins has been, and continues to be the most challenging life experience I&rsquo;ve ever had.  One of my closest friends is also gray dad, helping raise two stepdaughters before having two more children (his eldest daughter is around the same age as my twins).</p>
<p>My dad was 26 when I was born, 30 when my younger sister was born.  What they may not have given us when it came to material things was more than surpassed by the time, attention, and energy they gave us.  Decades later I can trace my loves of reading, museums, music, travel, nature, and cycling to time I spent with my dad doing all of those things.  I&rsquo;ve gotten to revisit some of the same places with my twins that my dad took my sister and I when we were small, including <a href="https://montgomeryparks.org/parks-and-trails/brookside-gardens/">Brookside Gardens</a> and <a href="https://montgomeryparks.org/parks-and-trails/wheaton-regional-park/">Wheaton Regional Park</a>.</p>
<p>How we parent is inevitably influenced by how we were parented, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.  Whenever I talk with my dad these days, he worries about where he fell short as a dad.  But considering that he was raised by his grandparents in Jamaica in the 1950s because his parents were teenagers, it&rsquo;s remarkable that he didn&rsquo;t allow his strict upbringing to translate into corporal punishment or strict religiosity in parenting my sister and I.  We did not lack for discipline or structure at all though.  When I reflect on how I parent, I must concede I&rsquo;m overly strict with the twins at times.  But I also hug my kids a lot more than my dad did us when we were growing up.  It was interesting to read about Cobb&rsquo;s fellow gray dads being more mature, having more insight, and being more patient, because I feel none of those things!  Whether it&rsquo;s my son having special needs or my daughter&rsquo;s anxiety challenges, I feel over-matched as often as I feel like I know the right course of action to take.</p>
<p>Cobb&rsquo;s last paragraph about &ldquo;awkward life talks&rdquo; brought back both memories of my dad giving me a book instead of a conversation about &ldquo;the birds and the bees&rdquo;.  It was also a reminder that we gray dads have more life behind us than in front of us and we need to take teh best care of ourselves possible so we can give our best to our children with the time we have.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is my tribute to Andor. There are many like it, but this one is mine.</p>
<p>As I write this, over a week has passed since the final three episodes of Andor aired.  The praise for the show has been nearly universal—and well-deserved.  A handful of monologues alone—from Karis Nemik, Luthen Rael, Saw Gerrera, and Mon Mothma—could be some of the best-written and best-delivered lines ever aired. But to figure out why this show worked so well across numerous dimensions—sci-fi, espionage, and politics—it took this brief video to find my answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8xY7cA_W7EU?si=waFa_znYb9tpX_cA">youtu.be/8xY7cA_W7&hellip;</a></p>
<p>About a minute into this interview with Anton Lesser (who plays Lio Partagaz), he relates a piece of advice that Tony Gilroy gave him: “Don’t think Star Wars, think John Le Carre.”  For me, that single phrase doesn’t just explain the brilliance of Andor, but Rogue One and the Bourne movies as well.</p>
<p>John Le Carré was only the best novelist working in the espionage genre of all time.  As a child raised on public television (including Masterpiece Theater), their adaptation of A Perfect Spy was my first exposure to serious espionage fiction.  Most of the best spy stories ever put on screen—Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, The Constant Gardner, The Night Manager, A Most Wanted Man—are adaptations of his work.</p>
<p>Even as someone who was confident that the Bourne movies would be good (having read some of Robert Ludlum’s novels many years before they were adapted for the screen), it wasn’t until seeing this little interview that Gilroy’s aspirations became clear.  With his work on Andor, he aspired to create a Le Carré-level espionage story within the Star Wars universe.  In retrospect, Gilroy writing all of the Bourne movies explains how much more grounded they seem when compared to most other spy movies and shows.</p>
<p>When it comes to my fandoms, espionage is the second-oldest behind science fiction. Before Andor, there was a similarly-brilliant show which ran for just two seasons called Counterpart.  Created by Justin Marks (who would go on to create the brilliant adaptation of Shogun), it’s a story set in parallel Earths created by a Cold War experiment in East Germany during the Cold War.  Counterpart sadly did not get the third season I felt it desired, and in retrospect Andor definitely scratched the particular itch of Cold War Berlin-based espionage story.</p>
<p>Growing up in the Maryland suburbs of DC, politics was and is a long-term preoccupation of mine.  NPR was always on the radio whenever my dad took my sister and I anywhere in the car.  My first real job was as a tech intern for The Washington Post during the 1992 presidential campaign.  Political dramas—both domestic and foreign (especially British ones) have always been interesting TV to me.  The original House of Cards was the first for me, followed by The West Wing, and the American remake of House of Cards, whose writing alum Beau Willimon would go on to play a prominent role in some of the best writing in Andor.  One of my social media mutuals succinctly described the greatness of the political aspects of Andor this way:</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/joshuafoust.com/post/3lpb2ezi6ek2i">“Yeah I love how it was presented as fully Arendt and didn’t insult us by pretending a tragic backstory can somehow justify monstrosity.”</a></p>
<p>Dr. Foust reminded me of a few key elements of Andor with this comment.  First, Hannah Arendt, the historian and philosopher who coined the phrase “the banality of evil” in writing about Adolf Eichmann’s trial for his role in planning and executing the Holocaust.  The Imperial Security Bureau (ISB) is fictional, but they seem deliberately reminiscent of the Stasi and the Gestapo which preceded it.  The characters who work for the ISB under Partagaz (Blevin, Meero) are ordinary people playing their parts as gears in the machinery of fascism.  Second, Syril Karn, who graduates from failed corporate cop in season 1 to ISB spy and Dedra Meero’s love interest in season 2, is the first of numerous ISB agents to be used up and discarded by the machine they’ve been serving.  Karn’s end is tragic, but it doesn’t make what he did to enable the Ghorman Massacre any less evil.</p>
<p>An underrated part of what makes Andor more than just entertaining is just how generous Tony Gilroy and the actors &amp; creators of the show have been in talking about what underlies the writing and their performances in interviews.  <a href="https://youtu.be/O3h-sVkZx-4?si=j8tapB3wum_RTZN2">What Gilroy says specifically about fascism in Andor</a> is very enlightening.  He’s also explicit about the 1942 Wannsee conference (where Third Reich high command plotted the so-called Final Solution) as a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/andor-season-2-premiere-nazi-link-1236191247/">reference for Krennic’s meeting</a> with select ISB officers plotting the pretext to crush Ghorman to take a mineral necessary to power the Death Star.  Particularly now when our own government is using its power to crush dissent in higher education, and to violate the rights of both immigrants and<br>
elected officials with impunity, Andor uses the galaxy far, far away to speak very loudly to the present moment.  Beyond the actual makers of the show, YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MaceAhWindu">MaceAhWindu</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GenerationTech">Generation Tech</a> have produced very thoughtful commentary on Syril Karn, Tay Kolma, Saw Gerrrera, and Lonni Jung.</p>
<p>Disney has submitted the 2nd season of Andor for Emmy consideration in numerous categories.  Regardless of whether they win or not, they have made a truly astonishing creation: a prestige drama in the Star Wars universe.  Andor is without doubt the finest show that Disney+ has ever made, and the very best Star Wars that isn’t The Empire Strikes Back or the original Star Wars.  It turns Rogue One from an interesting, stand-alone anthology entry into a fitting conclusion of Cassian Andor’s story.</p>

			 <p>Were it not for emails requesting donations from <a href="https://revealnews.org/">The Center for Investigative Reporting</a> and the <a href="https://www.icij.org/">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a>, I wouldn&rsquo;t have known today was World Press Freedom Day.  I&rsquo;ve been donating money to these organizations for years because I value and admire their work.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said of a great deal of the mainstream press.</p>
<p>Some will disagree but I believe it fair to argue that many in the mainstream press used their freedom to aid and abet the return of Donald Trump to the White House by consistently drawing false equivalences between him and Kamala Harris, and by normalizing and sane-washing his statements prior to the election when they were anything but.  In many ways, the biggest organs of the mainstream press continue the work of normalizing the abnormal whether it comes to continuing flurry of executive orders from the White House or the work of DOGE to infiltrate government and non-government entities alike to gain access to everyone&rsquo;s private data.</p>
<p>For in-depth reporting on what&rsquo;s happening in the Nation&rsquo;s Capital (effectively my backyard since I live in a Maryland suburb), I must depend on publications like <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired</a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/">ProPublica</a>, and other independent media sources instead of The Washington Post.  Independent journalists like Marcy Wheeler (of <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/">Emptywheel</a>), collectives like <a href="https://flaminghydra.com/">Flaming Hydra</a>, and others are doing the vital work of actually informing the public in this moment.  So on this World Press Freedom Day, if you&rsquo;re not already doing so, donate and/or subscribe to an independent media organization using their press freedom for good&ndash;and share their work.</p>

		<a href="https://genxjamerican.micro.blog/2025/04/19/i-am-weary-of-dispatches.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-04-19 20:47:48 -0400">Apr 19, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social/post/3ln6havvut22w">latest one</a> comes from John Dick (via excerpts from Mark Cuban), founder and CEO of a company called CivicScience who hails from Hyndman, PA.  We read that small-town PA doesn’t care about the global economy.  We read about population decline, closing of schools, the paucity of jobs, and the shorter life expectancy of its residents compared to residents of nearby Pittsburgh.  We read about the people of Hyndman valuing their “way of life”  more than money.  We read “both sides” condemnation of left elite snobs and right elite pols grasping for power, and justification of their continued support for Trump because there’s a 1% chance he might bring back those high-paying manufacturing jobs.  We’ve heard and seen and read many variations of this story.  NYT Pitchbot has mocked them with increasingly impressive accuracy for years.  But I am sick and tired of these stories.</p>
<p>Unspoken in seemingly every one of these dispatches from the so-called heartland is the overwhelming whiteness of the specific places they come from.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyndman,_Pennsylvania">reported demographics of Hyndman</a> as of 2000 are 98% white.  But rural and exurban America does not consist solely of white folks.  <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/mapping-rural-americas-diversity-and-demographic-change/">Nearly 25% of rural Americans were non-white</a>, per the 2020 census.  They’re living through all the same trends—if not worse, because of racism and xenophobia—as the people of Hyndman, and while Trump’s share of those voters increased, they fall far short of significant majority share of the white vote Trump has always had.  These wannabe tribunes of the white working class never have an explanation for why non-white working class people subscribe to Trump’s worldview at such significantly lower rates.</p>
<p>“But the economy is rocking!  Why don’t they just go to community college, move to the city, and learn to code?”  How are you sneering at community college and accusing others of being morally superior?  Community colleges educate and train the vast majority of people who work in hospitals that aren’t MDs?  My mother and many of their friends came to the country and went to community college to earn their LPN and then RN.  So do people who work as radiology techs, or phlebotomists.  Those jobs helped them build middle class lives for their children so we could build better lives for ourselves and our children.  One of my best friends has taught computer science at one of our local community colleges for a number of years.  People need to know what they’re talking about before they open their mouths to trash-talk community colleges.</p>
<p>It isn’t moral or intellectual superiority to say that at least one reason that places like Hyndman are dying is because of their hostility to immigrants and other forms of change.  Plenty of rural places in this country got a new lease on life because immigrants came and took the least attractive jobs, put money into housing and elsewhere in the local economy and helped revive otherwise flagging tax bases and dying main streets.</p>
<p>Resistance to change isn’t about education or culture, it’s about entitlement.  You can believe all you want that you are entitled to live the life you want to live without having to make any adjustments or changes, but that’s not the actual world we live in.  I was raised with a very clear understanding that the world doesn’t owe me a living, that success would require work, and that even hard work was not a guarantee of success.</p>
<p>Not caring about the way of life of other Americans isn’t a virtue—it’s selfishness.  And voting for Trump because he tells the lies that comfort you and hates the same people you blame for how your life has turned out will not improve your life in the slightest.  Continuing to support him even as he fails to deliver for Hyndman and every other majority white rural and exurban place in the United States in his second term exactly the way he failed to do in the first—while enriching himself and the same people he did the last time he was in office—makes you just the latest marks in his lifetime of fraud.</p>

			 <p>One small way I&rsquo;m pushing back against the anti-DEI tide is voting no on every such shareholder proposal for companies held in my retirement accounts.  A MAGA ETF called <a href="https://acvetfs.com/">American Conservative Values ETF</a> uses their holdings of common stocks to submit anti-DEI shareholder proposals.  US Bancorp is the first of my holdings where I found such a proposal (on <a href="https://pex.broadridge.com/getdocument.asp?doc=2FA052467AD7A9C8E06317289D0A8948&amp;type=edgar#3258969_2004540_2004665">page 83</a>), but I suspect it won&rsquo;t be the last.  I was heartened to see the board of directors recommend a no vote against this proposal and hope every public-traded company does so as well when such proposals are made.</p>

			 <p>According to <a href="https://apple.news/AK1v6RfyYRBeXs1jdBavglg">this Wall Street Journal story</a>, Google is the latest company to join the bandwagon of anti-blackness sweeping the tech industry in the wake of Trump’s return to the White House.  They emailed their staff and said Google “would no longer set hiring targets to improve representation in its workforce”.</p>
<p>What they’re really saying with that statement is that they’re no longer going to look everywhere for the best talent.  Google’s claim that they will “continue opening and expanding offices in cities with diverse workforces” doesn’t seem sincere or trustworthy either.  Entirely unaddressed by the story is the fate of the former Howard West (and current Tech Exchange), Google’s partnership with select HBCUs and HSIs to increase the number of black and Hispanic students in computer science.  Even the retention of affinity groups for minority employees seems like a cynical move to prevent a mass exodus of employees that would be bad for PR somehow in a way that multiple rounds of arbitrary layoffs have failed to be.</p>
<p>What Google, Amazon, Meta, and so many other companies are doing in not just abandoning any prior goals to seek talent everywhere, but scrubbing any evidence that they ever did so from their websites and annual reports creates an opportunity.  The opportunity is for those of us who are hiring managers at companies who still believe in looking everywhere for talent to make ourselves a destination for those folks.  This isn’t diversity for its own sake.  This is about winning in the marketplace by beating your competitors with talented people they choose to overlook.  When our results—especially the financial ones—prove superior to our cowardly competition, we need to be clear that our commitment to finding and hiring overlooked talent is why we’re winning.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://apple.news/ARqXG47naQqCbz2oCme6KDw">This Franklin Foer piece</a> is useful in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>it makes clear that the destruction of the administrative state currently in-progress is a longstanding GOP goal (not a new invention of Trump’s)</li>
<li>it correctly laments the human toll of the psychological warfare being waged on longtime civil servants</li>
<li>it makes clear that what we will lose is not just their knowledge, but the trust of the world when it comes to their investments</li>
</ul>
<p>Foer’s piece ultimately fails in critical ways which mirror what I expect we’ll continue to see from mainstream commentators.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the abject failures of Joe Biden’s presidency was that he did not proselytize for his own faith in institutions, which he considered the essential bulwarks against autocracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To write this about a man who allowed his own son to be prosecuted by an appointee of his predecessor’s choosing is absurd. His entire political career—presidency included—is a testament to his faith in institutions, even to his own personal detriment. His resorting to the use of pardons only in the waning days of his presidency is the one acknowledgment that the institutions of government have actually failed.</p>
<p>Foer’s choice of target for blame is emblematic of what I expect we’ll continue to see from the chattering class: blame for what Biden supposedly did not do. Nevermind the fact that many elected Democrats are failing to meet this moment. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/opinion/amy-klobuchar-interview-democrats-trump.html?smid=bsky-nytopinion">Amy Klobuchar</a> is still talking about finding common ground with a party that campaigned and won on mass deportation, racism, and anti-trans rhetoric.  Other Senate Democrats are taking social media lessons from Cory Booker while cutting deals with the GOP on Trump’s cabinet choices to avoid staying in Washington, D.C. over the weekend.</p>
<p>When it comes to what I read about the continuation of the government coup that began on January 6, 2021, I will be searching for the words “Biden” and “Harris” in advance before I invest any additional time in a piece. If they aren’t writing in detail about the nature and scale of misrule by Trump/Musk and their minions, and those trying to stop them, the words aren’t worth it.</p>

		<a href="https://genxjamerican.micro.blog/2025/01/29/how-my-plan-to-blog.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-01-30 00:21:09 -0400">Jan 30, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;d just finished listening to <a href="https://hanselminutes.com/series/top">episode 981 of the Hanselminutes podcast</a> on Blogging for Developers on my way home from work and felt inspired to write something.  The episode reminded me that I&rsquo;d started blogging way back in 2003, and that reading <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted">an old Scott Hanselman post</a> years after he wrote it pushed me to revive my own blog after about 5 years of social media posting instead.  But when I went to update my WordPress blog, something broke.  A week later, I still haven&rsquo;t figured out how to fix it.</p>
<p>Hanselman and his guest (Mark Downie) mentioned Micro.blog in the course of their conversation, its low hosting costs, and the &ldquo;publish on your own site, syndicate everywhere&rdquo; (<a href="https://alexn.org/blog/2023/09/21/post-once-syndicate-everywhere-pose/">POSSE</a>) concept it&rsquo;s built around.  I had already been on the hunt for new tech to host and run my blog with because of the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/14/wordpress_leader_matthew_mullenweg_exiles/">increasingly strange and hostile actions of WordPress co-founder Matthew Mullenweg toward WP Engine and other long-standing members of the WordPress community</a>. I hadn&rsquo;t made much progress yet with <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog">Eleventy</a>, and when I learned that Micro.blog had a WordPress import feature I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>So far, it looks like every post was pulled in successfully&ndash;even if certain images and embedded videos aren&rsquo;t currently showing correctly.  Those are things I can (and will) fix over time.  The words and ideas were (and are) the most important thing about my blog.  One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about how I use social media now is that the better tweets (or skeets) work like first drafts of ideas that I expand later with full blog posts.  I never posted many threads when I was more active on Twitter.</p>
<p>One analogy Hanselman drew that resonated with me when it comes to these social media sites is sharecropping.  His old post about owning your words quotes Tim Bray:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Own your space on the Web, and pay for it.  Extra effort, but otherwise you&rsquo;re a sharecropper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the lesson I forgot when it came to social media.  Downloading my Twitter archive regularly and thinking about ways to share pictures of my twins with my parents that don&rsquo;t involve Facebook or Instagram are just a couple of steps I&rsquo;m taking to own my words and my photos.</p>
<p>As for my WordPress blog?  I think an SSL certification issue may be the last remaining obstacle to genxjamerican.com working properly again.  But depending on how this experiment with Micro.blog works out, I may just redirect the domain here and bid WordPress farewell.</p>

<p>LOPBURI, Thailand — When Gustun Aunlamai arrived at school at age 4, he was so overweight that his teacher worried he’d have trouble breathing during naptime. His arms and legs were thick. His mouth peeked out from two ballooning cheeks. He moved slowly.</p>
<p>Throughout his toddler years, Gustun had regularly asked his parents to refill his bottle with his favorite “milk” — a type of formula made especially for kids his age. And they were happy to oblige. Sumet Aunlamai and Jintana Suksiri, who lived in a rural province north of Bangkok, had carefully chosen the brand.</p>
<p>Like other Thai parents, they’d been bombarded by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->formula advertising on television<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, online and in grocery stores, where a rainbow of boxes and canisters of powdered toddler milk featured teddy bears in graduation caps and giveaways like toys or diapers. It cost far more than cow’s milk but promised to make Gustun stronger and smarter.</p>
<p>What Jintana didn’t know, as Gustun chugged the formula and his weight neared 70 pounds, was that her son’s choice drink had sparked an international feud.</p>
<p>In 2017, Thai health experts tried to stop aggressive advertising for all formula — including that made for toddlers. Officials feared company promotions could mislead parents and even persuade mothers to forgo breastfeeding, depriving their children of the vital health benefits that come with it. At the time, Thailand’s breastfeeding rate was already among the lowest in the world.</p>
<p>But the $47 billion formula industry fought back, enlisting the help of a rich and powerful ally: the United States government.</p>
<p>Over 15 months, U.S. trade officials worked closely with formula makers to wage a diplomatic and political pressure campaign to weaken Thailand’s proposed ban on formula marketing, a ProPublica investigation found.</p>
<p>U.S. officials delivered <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a letter to Bangkok<!-- raw HTML omitted --> asking pointed questions, including whether the legislation was “more trade restrictive than necessary.” They also lodged criticisms in a bilateral trade meeting with Thai authorities and on the floor of the World Trade Organization, where such complaints can lead to costly legal battles.</p>
<p>Thai officials argued the new regulation would protect mothers and babies. In the end, though, the Thai government backed down. It banned advertising for infant formula but allowed companies to market formula for toddlers like Gustun — one of the industry’s most profitable and dubious products. The final law also slashed penalties for violators.</p>
<p>“Our law is really weak and enforcement is really weak,” said Dr. Siriwat Tiptaradol, who championed the proposed ban as a former adviser to Thailand’s health minister, in an interview in Bangkok. “I was upset and disappointed.”</p>
<p>The U.S. endeavor in Thailand was part of a decadeslong, global effort to protect the United States’ significant formula production and export business. ProPublica reviewed thousands of pages of emails and memos by U.S. officials, letters to foreign ministries, correspondence from industry groups and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->academic research<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We also interviewed health experts and government leaders in nearly two dozen countries, including former U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Together, the reporting shows the U.S. government repeatedly used its muscle to advance the interests of multinational baby formula companies, such as Mead Johnson and Abbott, while thwarting the efforts of Thailand and other developing countries to safeguard the health of their youngest children.</p>
<p>Just last March, at a meeting in Dusseldorf, Germany, U.S. officials opposed a reference to formula advertising bans in a new international food standard for toddler milk. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The move<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came <!-- raw HTML omitted -->after indust<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ry lobbying<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>At the center of many efforts was the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which advises the president on trade policy. Emails show its staff in regular contact with formula makers and their industry groups through meetings, calls and position papers — which the industry used to hammer its objections to regulations around the world. “Mead Johnson and other infant formula producers have been very vocal, expressing concerns to the Thai and U.S. governments about what they feel is the imminent passage of this measure,” U.S. officials wrote in 2016 as Thailand considered its formula marketing ban.</p>
<p>Officials with the USTR and other trade-focused agencies, including those within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, then echoed those positions in communications with other countries or in international forums like the WTO, the documents showed.</p>
<p>“The U.S. is highly influential,” said Dr. Robert Boyle, a doctor at Imperial College London who has researched international formula use.</p>
<p>In many places, the lobbying appeared to succeed. Hong Kong, for example, watered down some of its formula regulations after objections from U.S. trade officials, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->who said in a draft letter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the rules “could result in significant commercial loss for U.S. companies.” And a proposal in Indonesia stalled after questions from the U.S. at the WTO.</p>
<p>Notably, such advocacy has not only hindered local attempts to stop formula marketing that critics say is misleading or even predatory, but it has also undermined the work of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->U.S. foreign aid and health officials<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who have long supported breastfeeding across the globe. They call it “one of the highest returns on investment of any development activity” because of its well-documented benefits for babies’ health and cognitive growth.</p>
<p>“I think it is shocking,” said Jane Badham, an independent nutrition consultant and expert in child feeding who works internationally. “One doesn’t realize how much this kind of interference is happening.”</p>
<p>The meddling broke into public view in 2018, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->when officials from the Trump administration<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were accused of threatening to withhold military aid from Ecuador if the country didn’t drop its proposed resolution in support of breastfeeding at the World Health Organization; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the U.S. ambassador later denied<!-- raw HTML omitted --> making threats. But ProPublica’s investigation found that the scope of the interference far exceeded that incident and continues today under the Biden administration. In fact, Ecuador and Thailand were just two stops on a worldwide crusade against regulation that has spanned Republican and Democratic presidential administrations and touched more than a dozen countries, including South Africa, Guatemala and Kenya, as well as Southeast Asian nations such as the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Neither Abbott nor Mead Johnson responded to requests for interviews or to detailed questions from ProPublica. The latter’s parent company, Reckitt, also did not respond to our request for comment.</p>
<p>USTR officials declined to be interviewed for this story. In response to written questions, an agency spokesperson said in a statement that under President Joe Biden, the trade agency has emphasized respecting the role of foreign governments in deciding the appropriate regulatory approach, including with respect to infant formula. USTR has been committed “to making sure our trade policy works for people — not blindly advancing the will of corporations,” the statement said.</p>
<p>That has meant moving the office “away from the formerly standard view that too often deemed legitimate regulatory initiatives as trade barriers,” the spokesperson said, adding that the move has “enervated” corporate players who have been used to “getting their way at USTR for decades.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson, however, declined to provide examples of the new approach in relation to formula. She also declined to respond to questions about government documents that show the trade office under Biden working with other federal agencies to pursue the same playbook on formula as prior administrations.</p>
<p>In 2021, for example, officials complained to Filipino trade authorities about stricter formula marketing rules they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->considered “overkill,”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and expressed fears about regulatory “spillover” elsewhere in Southeast Asia. In Kenya, they sought to strike a provision in a proposed formula advertising ban after an industry group sent USTR a paper seeking its deletion.</p>
<p>Public health officials are increasingly raising concerns about toddler milk, especially as companies deploy advertising for products using bold — and, critics say, often unsupported — health claims.</p>
<p>In October, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a new report warning about the marketing for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->toddler formula<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. “Products that are advertised as ‘follow-up formulas,’ ‘weaning formulas’ or ‘toddler milks and formulas’ are misleadingly promoted as a necessary part of a healthy child’s diet,” said Dr. George Fuchs III, a lead author of the study. The drinks are worse than infant formula for babies under 1 year, he said, and “offer no benefit over much less expensive cow’s milk in most children older than age 12 months.”</p>
<p>Unlike infant formula, toddler milks are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Nutrition experts have warned about hefty doses of sweeteners and sodium in some brands.</p>
<p>The Infant Nutrition Council of America, a formula industry group, defended toddler drinks, saying they “can contribute to nutritional intake and potentially fill nutrition gaps for children 12 months and older.”</p>
<p>Toddler milk made up just 11% of all formula sales in the United States in 2023, but it was much more popular abroad, according to Euromonitor, which tracks sales data. Worldwide, it made up 37% of sales. In Thailand, it accounted for more than half.</p>
<p>The country is now struggling to address the consequences of the law’s weakening, researchers and officials say. More than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 in 10 Thai children<!-- raw HTML omitted --> under 5 years old face what researchers call a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“double burden of malnutrition”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that leaves some struggling with obesity and others lagging behind growth targets. Increased breastfeeding could help address both problems.</p>
<p>“You go to school and see a lot of kids are overweight,” said Dr. Somsak Lolekha, president of the Royal College of Pediatricians of Thailand and the Pediatric Society of Thailand. “We have a big problem in Thailand.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The warning dates to 1981, when the nations that make up the governing body of the WHO passed the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes. It aimed to stop all promotion of drinks meant to replace breast milk.</p>
<p>The move followed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reports in the 1970s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that thousands of infants in impoverished countries were falling ill and dying after drinking formula.</p>
<p>Not only were mothers using costly formula to replace breast milk, which would have given their babies better immunity, but the water parents mixed milk powder with was sometimes contaminated, leading to life-threatening bacterial infections and diarrhea. Overdiluted formula was causing severe malnutrition, too. Activists called for a boycott of the world’s biggest formula maker, Nestlé, which had heavily promoted its products in developing countries.</p>
<p>During the height of the controversy, an average 212,000 babies in low- and middle-income countries died preventable deaths linked to formula use annually, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an academic paper circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research<!-- raw HTML omitted --> estimated last year. (Nestlé disputed the research and said it was the first formula company to incorporate the WHO recommendations into its marketing policy in 1982.)</p>
<p>The United States cast the sole “no” vote against the international code, with the Reagan administration citing First Amendment protections on advertising. The Washington Post quoted a senior federal official who resigned over the decision, saying it would be “seen in the world as a victory for corporate interests.”</p>
<p>To be sure, formula was crucial for babies who didn’t have access to breast milk. But for those who did, public health experts feared aggressive advertising and free samples would derail a critical cycle. Once babies start drinking formula regularly, research shows, their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mothers’ breast milk supply can drop<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>“The evidence is strong,” <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a WHO and UNICEF report<!-- raw HTML omitted --> explains. “Formula milk marketing, not the product itself, disrupts informed decision-making and undermines breastfeeding and child health.”</p>
<p>In the years since the international code was adopted, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at least 144 countries<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have sought to enshrine its voluntary restrictions into laws that bar formula marketing in stores, hospitals and elsewhere. Despite poor enforcement in many places, the laws have had measurable benefits. Studies have shown that countries that adopted marketing bans <!-- raw HTML omitted -->saw their breastfeeding rates rise<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and more breastfeeding is in turn linked to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fewer infant deaths<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It also reduces mothers’ risk of certain cancers.</p>
<p>Baby formula manufacturers responded to slower growth in infant formula sales by creating products for older babies and toddlers — age groups that fell outside most regulations.</p>
<p>“We have a proven global demand-creation model,” Greg Shewchuk, Mead Johnson’s head of global marketing, told investors in 2013. “Capture baby very early on, often before it’s born, hold onto them through feeding and their feeding challenges and extend them as long as possible.”</p>
<p>Mead, which was based in the United States until a British company bought it in 2017, termed the strategy A-R-E: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Acquisition, Retention, Extension<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>To make toddler products more attractive to parents, who usually just gave their kids cheaper cow’s milk beginning at age 1, formula makers began adding nutritional supplements like DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish and algae with purported benefits for brain and eye health.</p>
<p>The claims, however, are unproven. Studies have found no definitive link between babies’ brain and eye development and DHA supplementation, a 2017 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->meta-analysis of 15 studies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> found, according to Cochrane, a nonprofit that supports systematic reviews of health research. In fact, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->breastfed babies perform<!-- raw HTML omitted --> better on intelligence tests.</p>
<p>Still, formula companies used additives like DHA “as a hook to expand their market share,” said Peter Buzy, CFO and treasurer of Martek Biosciences Corp., which produced DHA, at an analysts’ meeting in 2004. “Really targeting, you know, the sippy cups of the world.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Infant Nutrition Council of America defended the health and nutrition claims, saying they “are based on science and medical research and meet all legal, regulatory and nutritional science requirements.”</p>
<p>The marketing worked. Toddler milk has overtaken infant formula in worldwide sales, according to Euromonitor. Global toddler milk sales have grown by 25% since 2013, to almost $20 billion. A little less than two gallons of toddler milk can cost $30 or more, compared with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->around $3.94<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a gallon for regular milk in the U.S.</p>
<p>For formula manufacturers, the popularity of the product had another benefit: It helped them circumvent local rules against marketing infant formula. By using similar logos, colors or fonts across product lines, legal advertisements for toddler milk effectively promoted baby formula too, even in places where it was subject to a marketing ban. Nutrition experts and advocates called the tactic “cross-promotion.”</p>
<p>During the past decade, sales of regular infant formula grew about 10% worldwide, to $15 billion.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The family lived in military housing in Lopburi, a rural province two hours north of Bangkok whose capital city is world famous for its flourishing monkey population. With Sumet serving in the Army, Jintana took time off from her job in customer relations to care for the newborn.</p>
<p>She breastfed Captain until it was time to return to work three months later. The couple shopped for formula. Health claims formula makers listed on packages were “very important,” Sumet said through a translator. They settled on a product called Dumex that promised to strengthen Captain’s brain, immunity and eyes. It was made by the French giant, Danone, which boasts that the brand <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“has happily raised generations of Thais.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Millions of women like Jintana had been entering the workforce in developing regions such as Southeast Asia. The big six transnational companies that make most of the world’s baby formula saw this as a boon.</p>
<p>For Mead Johnson, the maker of Enfamil, the benefits of developing economies were twofold. “Firstly, in most countries, breastfeeding is incompatible with women participating fully in the workforce,” CEO Kasper Jakobsen said in a 2013 earnings call. “And, secondly, as women participate in the workforce, that creates a rapid increase in the number of dual-income families that can afford more expensive, premium nutrition products.”</p>
<p>By then, Thailand was Mead’s fifth-biggest market worldwide. And <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Southeast Asia was well on its way to becoming more important <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to the formula industry than the U.S. and European markets combined.</p>
<p>As business boomed, advocates lambasted the industry for its practices. Mead employees, for example, allegedly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bribed<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> health care workers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at government hospitals in China so they would recommend the company’s formula to new mothers — charges the company ultimately resolved with a $12 million settlement in 2015; the company did not admit or deny regulators’ findings in the agreement. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Danone faced similar allegations from Chinese media<!-- raw HTML omitted --> related to the brand Captain and Gustun drank, Dumex. Danone said at the time that it accepted responsibility for the lapses and suspended the program involved, according to the BBC.</p>
<p>The industry maintained close relationships with the medical establishment in Thailand, too. One pediatrician and advocate for breastfeeding, Dr. Sutheera Uerpairojkit, told ProPublica that two decades ago, she saw formula companies offer doctors and medical staff trips abroad in exchange for giving patients free samples and collecting their data. Some took the trips. Sutheera did not participate.</p>
<p>Thailand adopted the international code in 1984 — but only as a voluntary measure. Over the years, Siriwat and others pushed for tougher formula marketing restrictions without success. In one meeting, he and colleagues at the Thai health ministry pressed formula companies to comply with the voluntary rules, which they’d routinely broken. The businesses resisted. “One company said, ‘If I do not violate, I cannot compete with other companies,’” Siriwat recalled in September.</p>
<p>“That makes me very angry,” he said, remembering how he stormed out of the room.</p>
<p>By 2014, with Thailand’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->breastfeeding rate at only 12%<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, according to one survey, Siriwat persuaded the health minister to seek legislation to formally ban marketing infant and toddler formula. He wanted the new law to include enforcement and penalties for violators.</p>
<p>The WHO, a United Nations agency promoting health, wanted more countries to pursue such measures. Its staff in 2016 released new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recommendations on ending the promotion of formula products<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for toddlers, as well as infants. In theory, that guidance could help countries like Thailand fend off trade complaints about new marketing bans. And an endorsement by the WHO’s member nations would underscore the recommendations’ importance.</p>
<p>But public health wasn’t the only concern as nations prepared to vote.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Industry groups scrambled to arrange meetings with high-level officials in Washington. “Clearly, the potential economic and international trade implications from this proposed draft guidance are quite significant,” the pro-industry Infant Nutrition Council of America said in a letter to an FDA official in 2016.</p>
<p>That year, companies and trade groups connected to commercial milk formula, including Abbott Laboratories and Nestlé, spent almost $7 million lobbying U.S. officials about WHO matters, after a decade in which their lobbying disclosures had not mentioned the organization at all, a study found.</p>
<p>The industry’s outreach spanned Washington. The Infant Nutrition Council of America, for instance, lobbied the Senate, House and USTR — as well as the commerce, state, agriculture and health departments, lobbying records show. The efforts attracted the attention of leaders in both parties, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called President Barack Obama about the issue, according to records obtained by ProPublica.</p>
<p>Inside the administration, USTR took up the formula industry’s cause. “USTR does not support issuance of the guidance or resolution” on toddler milk, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote Jennifer Stradtman, a USTR official<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in an email to other federal officials. Furthermore, she wrote, her office “will not be able to accept” any resolution that encouraged WHO member countries to convert any of the guidance into law.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time the USTR sided with industry despite public health concerns: In 2013, a group of Democratic senators scolded <!-- raw HTML omitted -->U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for a proposal to help tobacco companies use trade law to “subvert” tobacco control measures — a stance the lawmakers called “deplorable and a serious threat to global public health.”</p>
<p>In the debate over toddler milk, officials from Froman’s office repeatedly questioned science, prompting a fight with public health officials, internal documents show.</p>
<p>In one exchange, then-USTR lawyer Sally Laing objected to a sentence from the guidance that said research suggests food preferences are established early in life.</p>
<p>“Unsupported,” Laing wrote.</p>
<p>Health officials pushed back on that, as well as other USTR edits. “MUST NOT DELETE,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protested in all caps, arguing that key language in the resolution was, in fact, backed by scientific evidence. But such concerns appeared to get lost in the debate, as those sentences were ultimately struck from the text.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as WHO member nations gathered to vote in Geneva, formula lobbyists had U.S. officials “on speed dial” and urged them to weaken the WHO resolution, said Jimmy Kolker, who led the negotiations for the U.S. as an assistant secretary in the Health and Human Services Department.</p>
<p>And the industry’s agents appeared to have inside knowledge. A baby-formula industry association lobbyist cornered Kolker. “From her approach, it was obvious to me that she had been forwarded an internal, very-limited-distribution USG email,” he wrote in an email to other U.S. government officials. “This is unacceptable and makes our job as negotiators significantly more difficult.”</p>
<p>In the end, the United States delegation persuaded WHO nations not to “endorse” their staffs’ own recommendations. Instead, the body voted only that it “welcomes with appreciation” the guidance — language that undercut its utility. The resolution, lacking the weight of an official endorsement, left many nations puzzled over whether it would help neutralize trade complaints.</p>
<p>“That has caused a lot of confusion,” said Laurence Grummer-Strawn, a WHO official who focuses on child feeding and former nutrition chief for the CDC. “What does that really mean?”</p>
<p>Stradtman and Laing could not be reached for comment. Froman did not respond to requests for comment, and a USTR spokesperson declined to comment on the office’s actions during the WHO debate. In a general statement, the spokesperson said that “with regard to infant formula, USTR, in conjunction with others in the interagency, work to uphold and advocate for policy and regulatory decisions that are based on science.”</p>
<p>The practical impact of the resolution’s weakened wording became clear within months, when the U.S. and other dairy producers like Australia and Canada accused Thailand of attempting to obstruct trade with its marketing ban. Thai officials argued their country had a “strong need for a regulation,” saying the “sales promotion” of milk formula for babies and toddlers contributed to the nation’s low rate of breastfeeding. But when it referenced the WHO’s guidance and resolution to support its position at the WTO, the U.S. countered that those measures did not amount to “an international standard.”</p>
<p>When the Thai National Legislative Assembly finally passed its formula marketing measure in April 2017, the provisions that the U.S. and its allies — plus some Thai doctors and industry lobbyists — had complained about most loudly were either watered down or gone entirely. Lawmakers had reduced the maximum criminal penalty for violations from three years in prison to one year in prison and the maximum fine from about $8,730 to $2,910, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a USDA document shows<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The law banned the marketing of infant formula and outlawed cross-promotion, but it still allowed advertising on products for 1- to 3-year-olds.</p>
<p>At a June 2017 meeting of the WTO, the U.S. called the changes “a welcome modification.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The couple diligently followed the “stages” prescribed by Dumex, which came in a cheery red package: Stage 1 formula when Gustun was an infant, Stage 2 when he was an older baby and Stage 3 when he became a toddler. He craved formula, and his parents, believing it was healthy, always gave him more. By the time he was 3, he reached his peak weight of about 66 pounds — the same as an average<!-- raw HTML omitted -->9-year-old<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. He was drinking six or seven bottles a day, each holding about 12 ounces of toddler milk.</p>
<p>Jintana wasn’t worried at first as Gustun grew pudgy. His brother, Captain, had been big, too — almost 60 pounds — at the same age. But when Gustun started school in person after the pandemic, his teachers were concerned. They had seen others arrive, as one put it, “addicted to the bottle.” The weight slowed Gustun down during movement time, his teacher Tida Rakrukrob said through a translator. “He would move slowly and was less active compared to other children,” she said.</p>
<p>When another teacher posted <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a video<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on TikTok showing herself comforting and talking with Gustun one day, it went viral — receiving 732,000 likes and many comments about how cute he was. But his teacher’s concern with his difficulty moving led his parents to bring him to see a doctor, who tested him for a hormone imbalance and checked him for diabetes. The tests came back negative. The parents reduced the fried food, dessert and snacks Gustun ate.</p>
<p>The biggest change the family made, though, was eliminating toddler formula from his diet. His school gave him cow’s milk instead, as it did for other children.</p>
<p>Gustun’s extra weight began to disappear.</p>
<p>Looking back, Jintana said she thinks he gained so much “because of the toddler milk.”</p>
<p>Today at age 6, Gustun is no longer on a restricted diet — he can eat fried food and dessert — and weighs 35 pounds, about half of what he weighed at the peak of his Dumex consumption. He is more outgoing at school, Jintana said, and plays soccer with his older brother every day. Captain lost a similar amount of weight after switching to cow’s milk at school and is now 9 and slim, weighing around 51 pounds.</p>
<p>One Monday in September, the brothers — both in soccer jerseys — kicked a ball back and forth in the driveway of the family’s brightly painted red house. Gustun, who has a lightning bolt shaved into his hairline, chased the ball and tried to get it away from his brother, who darted about quickly, tapping it from foot to foot.</p>
<p>“Now, his movement is perfect,” his mother said.</p>
<p>Danone, the company that makes Dumex, said in a statement that while breast milk offers children the best nutritional start, “50 years of scientific research into nutritional needs in early life underpins our products, and we do not make claims that have not been backed up by scientific research.” The company said that research has shown that toddler milk can provide nutrition and help improve the diet of children age 1 and older, reducing the risk of iron and vitamin D deficiency.</p>
<p>“We encourage parents to follow the guidelines on pack when using our products, which are carefully calibrated so that babies and infants receive the right amount of nutrients they need each day from our products,” the company said.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Indeed, at two supermarkets in Bangkok, shiny walls of powdered formula boxes seven shelves high greeted shoppers on a warm day in September. There were few differences between packages for products intended for babies and those intended for toddlers.</p>
<p>Formula makers and stores offered steep discounts for toddler milk, calling one a “Mommy Fair Shock Deal.” An offer on one shelf told parents if they spent about $87 on Hi-Q1 toddler formula, made by Danone, they could receive a free yellow and blue swing set worth about $27. Other offers included a clay “pizza dough cooking fun set,” a toy keyboard and microphone, and even a pushable “speedcar trolley” that a toddler could sit in.</p>
<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2022 study<!-- raw HTML omitted --> led by Nisachol found 227 instances of formula marketing that violated the law.</p>
<p>The government has levied fines for violations, but Thailand’s health ministry doesn’t name offenders. “The tactic is ‘I will violate your law,’” Siriwat said, “‘and prepare the budget for the fine.’”</p>
<p>Thai health authorities have tried to fight back by raising parents’ awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding. The health ministry, for example, erected billboards saying “breast milk is medicine” and called doctors to a meeting to urge them to promote breastfeeding among their patients. But these campaigns are no match for the formula companies’ massive spending on marketing, Siriwat said.</p>
<p>While Thailand’s exclusive breastfeeding rate for babies six months or younger rebounded to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about 29% in 2022<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, UNICEF found, it is still far short of the WHO’s target of at least 50% by 2025. The country’s rates of obesity and stunting for children 5 and under are higher today than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they were in 2016<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the year before the watered-down formula law passed.</p>
<p>Dr. Somsak Lolekha, president of the Thai pediatric society, said formula isn’t the only reason for children’s weight problems. But it plays a big role, he said, because it’s so easy to drink — a point that tracks with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->studies showing that<!-- raw HTML omitted --> babies who breastfeed longer are less likely to become obese and develop diabetes than those who drink formula.</p>
<p>Last summer, Thailand joined more than 100 nations at the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva to explore ways to fight unethical formula marketing. Attendees sat at long tables in a sleek, modern auditorium. Like other nations’ representatives, Dr. Titiporn Tuangratananon, an official with Thailand’s health ministry, declared her intentions on brightly colored paper posted at the front of the room: “Fully control” the marketing of formula to young children, and “Increase + expand enforcement.”</p>
<p>In an interview, Titiporn said health officials are trying to update the country’s marketing rules — including making some forms of toddler formula advertising, such as giveaways, discounts and free samples, illegal.</p>
<p>But that could ultimately prove difficult in a country that is now the seventh-largest market in the world for formula.</p>
<p>In fact, according to Titiporn, the government has already been deluged by public comments critical of its regulatory efforts. She suspected the pro-marketing remarks, some of which had been repeatedly copied and pasted, came from representatives of the formula industry.</p>
<p>“We know that it’s not real,” Titiporn said. “It’s not the real mothers.”</p>

<p>Before arriving here, Richards, like most Americans, never thought of child protective services as having a major presence in people’s lives, unless they’ve committed some sort of clear-cut child abuse. As a Black mother, she was more concerned about her kids encountering the police someday.</p>
<p>But within months, she found herself being investigated by the Arizona Department of Child Safety — based on the initial result of a drug test administered to her newborn daughter at the hospital, according to DCS case records she shared with ProPublica and NBC News.</p>
<p>It is not hospital policy to test for drugs after all births, but staff told her that she and her child were being screened because she was from out of town, she said. Richards, who tested negative for substances herself, believes the reason was the color of her skin.</p>
<p>DCS then prohibited her from being alone with her baby for five days while a caseworker interrogated her about her marital status, whether she received food stamps and how she usually handles stress, the records show. The investigator also inspected her other six children’s bodies and questioned them for hours about their chores, their meals, their mom’s employment and more.</p>
<p>Then, the department learned that there had been a false positive on the test and deemed the case unfounded, according to the records.</p>
<p>“They never explained or apologized,” Richards said.</p>
<p>Just months later, Richards, a case manager for a behavioral health care company, was investigated again, when she sought medical care after her daughter fell off a couch. That allegation of child maltreatment, too, was unfounded, according to a DCS spokesperson.</p>
<p>The department declined to comment further on the two cases.</p>
<p>Richards now feels intense dread when any of her children have even a minor injury or come down sick, fearing that DCS will show up again if she takes them to the doctor.</p>
<p>And in the years since her own experiences with Arizona’s child welfare system, she said, two of her family members in Phoenix, as well as a neighbor and a client at her job, have also endured these investigations of their parenting. All of them are Black.</p>
<p>From 2015 to 2019, the last full year of federal child welfare statistics available before the pandemic, DCS investigated the family lives of 1 of every 3 Black children in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous county and home to Phoenix, according to an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->analysis by ProPublica and NBC News<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of data obtained from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect.</p>
<p>Last year, a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->study published by the National Academy of Sciences<!-- raw HTML omitted --> used similar data to project that by the time Black children in Maricopa County turn 18, there’s a 63% chance that they will see their parents investigated by child services, the highest rate of any of the 20 largest counties in the nation.</p>
<p>Put another way, more Black children in metro Phoenix will go through a child maltreatment investigation than won’t.</p>
<p>That’s significantly more likely than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a Black teen being stopped by the police<!-- raw HTML omitted --> — an issue that has gained far more attention in recent years — according to multiple studies and interviews with criminal justice data experts.</p>
<p>Over the past year, ProPublica and NBC News have interviewed more than 30 Black parents across the Phoenix region who’ve faced a child welfare case, as well as several of their children and an additional nine teenagers who experienced DCS investigations.</p>
<p>Some of the parents were working single dads or moms, like Richards, many of them living in the historically Black neighborhood of South Phoenix. Some were middle-class couples in the cactus-lined gated communities that dot suburbs like Mesa and Glendale. Some were adoptive parents, or extended family members caring for a child.</p>
<p>Almost all described a system so omnipresent among Black families that it has created a kind of communitywide dread: of that next knock on the door, of that next <!-- raw HTML omitted -->warrantless search of their home<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And many expressed disbelief that it was so easy for the state government to enter their family realm and potentially remove their kids from them.</p>
<p>Black families and their advocates said DCS’ ubiquity does not just take the form of unnecessary investigations in which racial bias may have played a role, as Richards believed happened in her case. It’s also a product, in some cases, of public policy choices in Arizona that take a punitive rather than preventative approach toward Black parents, many of whom are struggling under the legacy of racism, a lack of inherited wealth and a slashed social safety net.</p>
<p>The state — the last in the nation to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday, in 1992 — spends a majority of its welfare budget on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DCS investigations<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> rather than on direct assistance<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to families in need, as ProPublica reported last year.</p>
<p>These priorities are borne out in the data.</p>
<p>Only 2% of children in Maricopa County whose families were accused of child maltreatment from 2015 to 2019 were ultimately determined or suspected by caseworkers to be victims of any form of physical or sexual abuse following an investigation, one of the lowest rates among large counties in the U.S.</p>
<p>But 15% allegedly experienced neglect, a term encompassing parenting problems typically associated with poverty, including a lack of decent housing, child care, food, clothing, medical care or mental health treatment. The category also includes alcohol and drug use, which numerous studies have found are more policed but no more common among Black or low-income people than other groups.</p>
<p>Roughly 20% of Black people in Maricopa County are living below the poverty line, compared to about 13% of all county residents, though having money should not be thought of as a requirement for good parenting, family advocates said.</p>
<p>In an interview, the director of DCS, Mike Faust, said the data used for this article is based on a stretch of time, 2015 through 2019, that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->began with a caseload crisis<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the department. Over that period, he said, the agency made sweeping changes, including improving its intake and risk assessment tools in order to reduce subjective decision-making and unnecessary investigations.</p>
<p>“We’ve gone from what I think most people would describe as the worst-performing child protection agency in the country to one that — I don’t know if you’ll ever have a high-performer child protection agency, given the nature of the work we do — but it’s drastically different,” said Faust, who is white and has led the agency since 2019.</p>
<p>Yet the most recent available federal data through September 2020 shows that while it is true that DCS has reduced the overall number of families it looks into statewide, the decline did not improve — and in fact worsened — the racial disparity.</p>
<p>Although 7,400 fewer white children were the subject of investigations completed from the 2016 to 2020 fiscal years, the number of Black kids whose parents were investigated dropped by less than 100. (Some children did not have a race identified.)</p>
<p>“It didn’t have an immediate impact on just African American children,” Faust acknowledged. “The commitment that I make is to continue to stay engaged as an organization. And trust me, these are some challenging conversations to be in. It’s been difficult. But you’ve got to keep coming back to the table regardless of, at times, that people share that raw emotion.”</p>
<p>Faust, a conservative Republican with a private-sector background, may be out of a job by next spring. The election last month of Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, as Arizona governor likely means that DCS will have a new leader and possibly a new approach to racial disproportionality in the coming years.</p>
<p>In a statement, Joe Wolf, a spokesperson for Hobbs’ transition, pointed out that her career has included stints working with homeless youth and helping to run one of the largest domestic violence shelters in the country, giving her perspective on what affects Arizona’s most vulnerable. Wolf also said that as the governor-elect prepares to take office, her team is developing plans to improve the way the state provides social services, including “addressing the racial disparities that have plagued the system for so long.”</p>
<p>Still, Black community leaders in Phoenix continue to have concerns, saying that it has been challenging to effectively advocate for reforms across both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p>
<p>For one thing, the metro area’s Black community — just 7% of its population — is sparse and spread out compared to that of similarly large U.S. cities. That makes it hard to organize around this common experience to make DCS a pressing political issue and hold its officials accountable.</p>
<p>What’s more, sharing that you were investigated by child services remains more stigmatizing in many families than saying you’ve been stopped by the police.</p>
<p>As a result, some local leaders said it took them a while to realize just how pervasive DCS’ presence is.</p>
<p>Janelle Wood, founder and president/CEO of Phoenix’s Black Mothers Forum, said that when she started her community organization in 2016, she thought its members would mainly be focused on police violence and the criminalization of Black youth, which they have been to an extent. “But what kept coming up at meetings was DCS,” she said, noting that the confidentiality of the gatherings allowed for these conversations. “The most heart-wrenching stories — so many mothers had them.”</p>
<p>Kenneth Smith, principal of a Phoenix alternative high school and a community organizer who works with the local chapter of the NAACP and a group of nonprofits in the city, said he doesn’t usually talk about this issue openly due to the stigma, even though he knows of several people who’ve had DCS cases.</p>
<p>The statistics identified by ProPublica and NBC News, he said, are “like turning on the lights, and all of us are now standing in the room together saying, ‘What? You too?’”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What reporters have found is that child protective services agencies investigate the home lives of roughly 3.5 million American children each year, opening refrigerators and closets and searching kids’ bodies in almost every case. Yet they determine there was physical or sexual abuse in only about 5% of these investigations.</p>
<p>And while Phoenix is an outlier, the racial disproportionality of this system is a national problem.</p>
<p>Matthew Stewart, the son of the longtime senior pastor of Phoenix’s most prominent Black church, First Institutional Baptist, joined DCS as a case manager in 2009. He did so in part because he had an interest in social justice and youth mentorship from his upbringing.</p>
<p>But in 2018, Stewart, by then a training supervisor, came across an internal agency spreadsheet showing a large racial disparity in Arizona’s foster care population, which mainly consists of children removed from their families following investigations. He hadn’t fully absorbed the problem until then.</p>
<p>He was flooded with shame.</p>
<p>Stewart quit two years later, after deciding he couldn’t achieve meaningful change from within the department. He has since founded a community organization, Our Sister Our Brother, which advocates helping families rather than separating them.</p>
<p>Generational poverty and the resulting trauma within families have been “centuries in the making,” he said. Are parents supposed to believe that after DCS takes custody of their children, “these things will be solved?”</p>
<p>“I simply don’t think DCS is the agency to do this,” he said.</p>
<p>One of the parents whom Stewart has partnered with is Tyra Smith, of nearby Mesa, who now works for his growing group as a parent advocate.</p>
<p>In 2020, Smith left her four sons (triplets who were 7 as well as a 4-year-old) in her apartment for roughly 20 minutes, according to a case report. She said she was going for a walk to calm down after a heated argument by phone with her sister, who then called the police on her.</p>
<p>While she was away, a police officer arrived and called DCS because she wasn’t there. Responding to her alleged lack of supervision and her growing anger about the ensuing encounter, the department removed all of her boys that night, agency records show.</p>
<p>As often happens in the child protection system, this temporary removal led to a broader DCS inquiry into Smith’s mental health history, her troubled relationship with her ex, her marijuana use (which is legal in Arizona) and the tidiness of her home, records show. Based on these concerns, the department kept custody of the boys for a year and a half before returning them.</p>
<p>Smith said that when she was growing up, her own mother underwent such an investigation, and that several of her friends from school, all Black, have since endured one as new parents.</p>
<p>Now, she worries about her sons getting arrested or shot when they are older; when that happens to Black men, she pointed out, the news reports often say, “Oh, their childhood, they were ‘in the system.’”</p>
<p>“It becomes a generational curse,” Smith said.</p>
<p>ProPublica and NBC News presented DCS spokesperson Darren DaRonco with the names and anecdotes of the families described in this article, and he checked with agency leadership and case records and said that all of them were indeed investigated and that there was nothing inaccurate in their recounting of events. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Arizona law<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, he noted, would allow him to clarify or correct anything that is factually wrong.</p>
<p>In interviews, Katherine Guffey, executive consultant to DCS’ director, pointed to additional steps that their team has taken to address the disproportionality issue, especially since the racial justice movement following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.</p>
<p>The department, said Guffey, who is white, has been incorporating the feedback of Black employees who formed a disparity committee, including Stewart before he left, helping them to write a charter and create an action plan. Staff have also taken part in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->workshop on the systemic causes of racial inequity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, as well as an empathy training developed by Arizona State University professors.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, DCS helped convene a confidential two-hour focus group of a dozen Black people to hear how the department’s frequent involvement with families has affected them. The child welfare consulting firm Casey Family Programs has been brought in to hold continuing discussions.</p>
<p>And the agency plans to start a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cultural Brokers program<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to ensure that a trusted community member of the same race is present upon parents’ contact with caseworkers.</p>
<p>Critics say that while these are positive moves, no proposals have been made that would rein in the fundamental power of this agency, which has a billion-dollar budget, to remove children from their loved ones.</p>
<p>As Stewart put it, “We have a culture that says Black families need to be watched and if we don’t agree with the things that are going on with them, we are the saviors of these children and are charged with punishing their parents.”</p>
<p>Until that fundamental outlook of the child welfare system changes, he said, some of the well-intended steps being taken may amount to just restating or even perpetuating the problem.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These families were soon forced to live in South Phoenix via redlining and racial covenants, which blocked them from renting or owning property anywhere else.</p>
<p>Yet despite the injustice of residential segregation, said Rod Grimes, a scholar of Arizona Black history, it did create a sense of Black density in a town that still had few Black people. Once families were able to move, many heading to the suburbs, he said, some of that strength in numbers fell away.</p>
<p>Today, Black residents of metro Phoenix are geographically and therefore politically diffuse. Without either the powerful voting blocs that exist in some parts of the South or the sense of protection of living in a majority-Black urban neighborhood elsewhere, they are more likely to be surrounded by white neighbors, teachers and health care workers whom they fear could call DCS on them, many said in interviews. They are also less likely to have the legislative representation that could conduct oversight of the department or fight for better social services to help prevent child welfare cases.</p>
<p>Even after the November election, Arizona has just two Black state legislators out of 90 — the same number as in 1950.</p>
<p>The result, said Clottee Hammons, an Arizona history expert and the creative director of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Emancipation Arts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is a business-oriented white leadership class whom she and other Black Arizonans feel cannot relate to what it is like to raise a Black child, let alone on a low income.</p>
<p>Due to this experiential gap in the halls of power, critics say, the state Legislature rarely addresses concerns specific to Black families, instead focusing on topics of interest to many white voters, like school choice and border security.</p>
<p>Nor have lawmakers created a well-funded, easily accessible statewide system that parents living in poverty (as well as mandated reporters of child neglect, like teachers) can call to get help. Many other states have invested heavily in such services, but in Arizona the main option is to call DCS, which comes with the possibility of family separation attached.</p>
<p>In a statement, DaRonco, the department spokesperson, said of the parents and community members making this criticism, “We share their desire to reduce DCS presence in their homes by creating access to community-based supports that get them what they need without the stress of a DCS encounter.”</p>
<p>Once DCS is involved, the emphasis is on child safety and possibly child removal rather than addressing problems at their root, as reflected in the agency’s funding structure. In fiscal year 2022, the department spent roughly $90 million on group homes and other congregate facilities for foster youth, $99 million on foster care and $278 million on adoptions, compared to just $15 million on prevention efforts and $29 million on in-home services for families themselves.</p>
<p>DaRonco noted that top-line decisions about how DCS spends its funding are made by the Legislature, not the department. He added that the budget includes additional subsidies for parenting programs and substance use treatment, which can lead to family reunification.</p>
<p>Much of the foster care and adoption money comes from the federal government <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the form of annual incentives<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>“I’m just telling you, people in the community feel like their babies are being sold and trafficked — that’s how easy it feels, and how profitable,” said Roy Dawson, executive director of the nonprofit Arizona Center for African American Resources and a leading Phoenix advocate for racial equity in the child welfare system.</p>
<p>Dawson also said that all the well-meaning foster care nonprofits in Arizona, which exist in part because there is so much funding available for foster care in the state, help perpetuate the system’s vast size and reach.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether the election of Hobbs as governor will translate into a realignment of budget priorities at DCS, let alone a shift in the anti-poverty agenda at the Legislature, where Republicans continue to hold a majority.</p>
<p>Many families and experts were also skeptical about the possibility of change because of the agency’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->long history<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of claiming to address its <!-- raw HTML omitted -->problems with race<!-- raw HTML omitted --> without <!-- raw HTML omitted -->making much progress<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>In 1995, the Arizona Republic published a story about child protective services with the sub-headline, “Blacks are overrepresented in Arizona’s system, study says.” The article went on to say, “Officials haven’t been able to find out why Arizona’s figures are 2.5 times the national average” and that “the state has formed a task force to examine why Blacks are having difficulty.”</p>
<p>In 2008, Arizona reported to the federal government that it was developing an “Eliminating Racial Disproportionality and Disparity” strategy for its child welfare system, which would include technical assistance to evaluate Maricopa County’s data on race as well as a focus group and a training video.</p>
<p>And in a 2014 DCS report, the agency said it was partnering with local churches as part of a racial “Gap Closing Collaborative.”</p>
<p>“I can say with certainty that many DCS and previous CPS administrations have seen this information and been aware of it,” Guffey acknowledged, referring to the former name of the department.</p>
<p>Dana Burns, a mom, musician and founder of the child welfare advocacy organization A Permanent Voice Foundation in South Phoenix, says that DCS’ pervasiveness in the community feels of a piece with a larger anti-Black attitude that she and other parents face in this state, from officials and neighbors alike.</p>
<p>“It’s Arizona,” she said. “It’s an attitude that we were never supposed to be here.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Department data show that its frontline staff are most often white and disproportionately in their 20s, which reflects national trends. Many said in interviews that this was their first or second job out of college, and a large proportion do not have children themselves. Turnover at the agency has also been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->notoriously high<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, further lowering the average experience level.</p>
<p>As a result, the typical scenario is a white person with little or no parenting experience entering a Black home and having minimal time, by the nature of the job, to make a judgment as to whether what is going on there is dangerous for kids.</p>
<p>“It felt like we were on display, like they had a white glove on checking everything. And I had to smile and say good morning,” said Tressie King, who lives with her husband Jamel and their 13-year-old adoptive son in the suburb of Chandler. (King was accused of briefly leaving her child, who is autistic, unattended in her car while she ran in to a store, an allegation that case documents show was ruled unfounded but only after several inspections of their home.)</p>
<p>“It felt like they were checking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me<!-- raw HTML omitted --> out, not my child,” she said. “I said if I am being made to feel ashamed, how is that good for the kid?”</p>
<p>Many Black parents also said that if they get combative, precisely because the most precious thing in their life may be about to be taken from them, their anger is too often interpreted as a potential threat.</p>
<p>Sarah Encarnacion, a DCS child safety specialist from 2019 to 2021, said her goal was always to keep families together and for them to feel she was a trusted presence. But she acknowledged that as “a small, petite white woman,” she was “responsible for preparing and educating myself on how to enter this home where I’m such a foreign entity.”</p>
<p>DaRonco, the spokesperson, said that DCS has several initiatives to “change the power dynamic” between its staff and the families they work with. These include holding “team decision making” meetings near the beginning of an investigation, so that parents — and any friends, neighbors, teachers, clergy or others they want with them in the room — can have more of a say in the process.</p>
<p>There are also differences in cultural attitudes toward corporal punishment, which is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more common on average<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Black families. Many Black parents and children interviewed for this article distinguished between what they called a whooping and abuse, with some parents saying they would rather spank a child, which is legal in Arizona, than risk the child getting out of line and experiencing something far worse at the hands of a police officer.</p>
<p>“Nine times out of 10, parents raise their kids how their parents raised them,” said Richards, the Phoenix mother accused at the hospital, who has since become an advocate around the child welfare issue. “If the state is not agreeing with that way of raising kids, the solution is just to take the children every time? Every generation?”</p>
<p>Richards and many others said DCS’ prevalence can eventually cause insidious damage to relationships between Black parents and their children, who sometimes threaten to call DCS on each other when they’re in normal family disputes.</p>
<p>“That’s messed up,” she said, but the agency has become “so much a part of our lives that it’s a real thing to say.”</p>
<p>In part because of her struggles with the child welfare system, Richards said that she and her family are planning to relocate again, likely leaving Arizona next year.</p>
<p>Stephan Muhammad, a chef who lives in a suburban development in South Phoenix, agrees that no matter what DCS is now doing to address racial disproportionality, its harms linger in Black families like his.</p>
<p>Muhammad had his children taken from him by the department twice; they were placed in foster care, including group homes where <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they say they experienced repeated violence<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for about two years in each case. The first time was based on a neglect allegation that he left his four youngest at home while he picked up his oldest daughter at kindergarten just across a nearby park. The second was for spanking his son, who was nearly 9 at the time, for getting in trouble at school — which the agency said was child abuse, according to Muhammad, his family members and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reporting by the Arizona Republic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>In both cases, a judge ultimately returned them home.</p>
<p>“I missed years of my childhood,” said one of his daughters, Sierra, 12, who was separated from her siblings while in state custody. “If I could talk to the head of DCS, I would say don’t take my father from me ever again.”</p>
<p>In an interview at Muhammad’s house, in front of a wall-sized calendar on which one of his children had written in the square of his birthday, “aka Big Head Day,” he said that he obviously has been overjoyed to have them all back. Still, he said he feels a trepidation that thousands of Black parents across Phoenix must be coping with every day: Is he in fact a bad parent?</p>
<p>“It’s impossible not to internalize,” he said. “It’s an attack on who you are as a parent in every way.”</p>

			 <p>The following tweet starts an excellent thread of questions that I&rsquo;m taking as a starting point for this post looking back over the past 5 years with my current company:
<a href="https://twitter.com/lilykonings/status/1484598087494496258?s=20">twitter.com/lilykonin&hellip;</a></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When was the last time you promoted someone on your team?  How did it happen? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My organization works in a way that promotion decisions are actually approved (or rejected) at a much higher level than mine.  But I&rsquo;ve advocated successfully for promotion for two of my direct reports, both during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The first was a recent college graduate who spent the 18 months of his professional career on my team.  While I wasn&rsquo;t his manager for the entirety of that time, I encouraged him to work on communication across various channels (Slack, email, documentation, pull request comments, etc).  I did what I could to put opportunities in front of him to grow and showcase his skills.  What he did on his own (in addition to pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in computer science on the side) was earn AWS certifications.  He passed 4(!) in a single calendar year.  So when it came time to year-end reviews, there were a lot of accomplishments to point to as well as positive feedback from people outside our team from their experiences of working with him.  He was the first direct report I had who earned the highest possible year-end rating: exceptional, and the first promotion (to senior engineer).  He&rsquo;s still with the company today, and received another promotion (to principal engineer) in the same cycle I received a promotion to senior manager.</p>
<p>The second promotion was for someone who had been with the company longer than I had.  From what I was told she had been submitted for promotion once or twice before but had not been selected for promotion.  She was (and is) one of those engineers who leads much more by example than by talking.  Having observed over the years that the review process tends to overindex on software engineers that present well, I became the person in meetings who consistently pushed people to consider written communication as well as presentations in judging the quality of an engineer&rsquo;s communication.  I also recommended she take the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->technical writing courses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> offered by Google.  These steps, plus highlighting her numerous critical contributions to the team&rsquo;s success during another year-end review cycle appear to have been enough to get her promoted to principal engineer.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why did the last person in this role leave?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s been long enough that I don&rsquo;t actually recall why the previous leader of the team moved on.  I presume they found an opportunity with another company.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How do you nurture psychological safety in your team?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regular one-on-ones (I follow a weekly cadence for these) has been important to nurturing psychological safety.  Because I joined the team to lead it after work-from-home began, Zoom meetings were really the only avenue available to build the rapport necessary for my team to trust me.  I also started a technical book club with the team, with the intention of giving my team exposure to software design and implementation principles outside the scope of our current work, along with providing opportunities for each member of the team to lead discussions and explore ideas.  It seems to have had the additional benefit of building everyone&rsquo;s comfort level with, and trust in, each other along with all the other things I&rsquo;d intended it for (including ideas originating from book club showing up as production enhancements to our software).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When was the last time you supported a direct report&rsquo;s growth, even if it meant leaving your team or company?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In my previous department, I had staffing responsibilities for two teams for awhile: one composed entirely of contractors in addition to my own team.  In helping a scrum master friend of mine diagnose the causes of the contractor team struggling to be productive, I concluded that the main issue wasn&rsquo;t technical expertise but the lack of a leader to help remove impediments and connect them with others in the organization who could help their tasks move forward.  I proposed this as a leadership opportunity for one of my direct reports and got buy-in from higher-level management.  He was so successful in the stretch opportunity I created, he got promoted after leaving my team.  Not long after that, he left our organization to join Amazon as an engineering team lead in Seattle.  He&rsquo;s currently a principal software engineering manager with Microsoft in Atlanta.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Can I speak to some women on the team to hear more about their<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->experience?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two of the engineers on my current team are women.  If all goes well, another one of them will be promoted to principal engineer by virtue of her performance over the past 18 months.  While it will likely mean losing her to another team, her getting promoted and gaining new opportunities that my team&rsquo;s scope doesn&rsquo;t provide is more important to me.  I see it as another opportunity to build up another engineer in her place.</p>

			 <p>While my own experience on Mastodon has been a positive one so far, my experience is by no means universal.  As more prominent accounts from Twitter have joined, particularly those of black folks (and especially black women) I&rsquo;ve followed there for awhile, they&rsquo;ve begun to share details of consistently negative experiences on Mastodon.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/IBJIYONGI/status/1590462702983720962?s=20&amp;t=ioNxgCoz-zhuVl8vnfQQkQ">twitter.com/IBJIYONGI&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Her experience has been difficult enough that the Mastodon post sharing that she was taking a break from that platform linked to the tweet above.  It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a more damning indictment of how a platform treats people from marginalized communities than posting that criticism on Twitter, a site that has done far less policing of slurs against black people in the wake of Elon Musk&rsquo;s purchase.  Trying to summarize her thread wouldn&rsquo;t do it justice, but if there is any common thread between her negative experience and that of other black people on Mastodon it is around the content warning feature (abbreviated CW as shown below).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Dr. Prescod-Weinstein&rsquo;s objection to the name of the feature is a function of being a rape survivor.  The other pushback I&rsquo;ve seen most often is around the use of the feature for posts regarding racism.  Elon James White, who I first started following during his coverage of Ferguson in the wake of the protests of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Michael Brown&rsquo;s shooting death by police officer Darren Wilson<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, refuses to use it for discussions of racism.  Mekka Okereke, director of engineering for the Google Play online store, has a more nuanced viewpoint, which separates whether or not white people want to hear about racism from what is effectively a mislabeling of the feature.  He summarized his feelings on this as follows:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Mastodon (and the Fediverse)&rsquo;s turn in the spotlight, and the negative experiences of at least a few black people on it I follow make it a microcosm of both the best and the worst aspects of tech more broadly.  A few of the best aspects: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->software a young man named Eugen Rochko first started writing in 2016<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, has held up rather well all things considered against a significant increase in usage and attention.  It&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->open source<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so not only can you see how it works, you can suggest changes, or even make a copy of it and make changes yourself if you have the time and expertise.  It uses a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->decentralized social networking protocol<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that doesn&rsquo;t just interoperate with other Mastodon servers, but with other social networking applications that use the same protocol.  Despite the good&ndash;which is significant&ndash;Mastodon is just as susceptible to some of the negative aspects of the for-profit tech industry it intends to be an alternative to.  The most obvious negative aspect is the gatekeeping.  Despite beginning my professional career just a few years after the founder of Mastodon was born, it would take over 15 years of that career before I would find an employer where there was more than one other person who looked like me writing software for a living.  Software engineers who are Hispanic or Latino aren&rsquo;t that much less rare than black software engineers.  Today, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the percentage of women in technical roles is projected to be around 25% by the end of this year<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  But the history of computing predates the machines that do it today, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a much higher percentage of those literal human computers were women<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Those women who do persevere through the gatekeeping that would prevent them from entering the industry ultimately end up leaving at unfortunately high rates because of the hostility to women that still persists in too many work environments.</p>
<p>Tim Bray (co-author of the XML spec and contributor to numerous web standards), shared <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as one of his first posts on Mastodon.  I have no doubt that he meant well, and that the author of the piece meant well, but when you title a piece &ldquo;Home invasion&rdquo; when talking about new users of a platform you&rsquo;re used to, that comes across as incredibly hostile.  The same author that talks about trans and queer feminists building the tools, protocols, and culture of the fediverse makes not a single mention of people of color in his piece&ndash;not unlike the commercial tech companies in general, and Twitter in particular that are among the targets of his critique.  The entire piece is worth reading in full to understand the author&rsquo;s perspective, but I will pull quote and highlight one paragraph that seems most emblematic of the blind spot that some veteran Mastodon users appear to have:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I said at the start of this piece, my own experience with Mastodon has been a positive one so far.  Some of it is a function of having participated in online communities for decades (as far back as the Usenet newsgroups days), and even becoming a private beta tester one of the newer ones (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackOverflow.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) before it went public.  But those communities too had their gatekeepers, mansplainers, and jerks.  Certain open source projects are unfortunately no different in that regard either.  There&rsquo;s something to be said for understanding the pre-existing culture of a place&ndash;even if it is virtual.  That said, the idea that culture is static&ndash;and should remain so&ndash;is a perspective that it seems some Mastodon veterans would do well to change.  Otherwise, they risk perpetuating the same harms as commercial social media&ndash;just without the financial rewards.</p>

			 <p>As I mentioned at the end of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my first post on Mastodon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I&rsquo;ve been following <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Martin Fowler&rsquo;s notes on his own journey<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  His November 1 memo on verification interested me, especially in light of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter&rsquo;s recent update to charge $8 for the blue check mark<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>As Fowler explained it, Mastodon being decentralized (unlike Twitter) means verification is up to each server.  Whoever runs it can verify members however they wish&ndash;or not at all.  The approach to verification he describes and implements is what he calls cross-association.  By adding a &lt;link&gt; element to the &lt;head&gt; of his personal website with an href attribute for his corporate Mastodon profile, Mastodon &ldquo;sees&rdquo; the link and marks it as verified.</p>
<p>I followed Fowler&rsquo;s example to do the same thing with my Mastodon profile.  I updated the header.php of the WordPress theme I&rsquo;m using this way:</p>
<p>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;&lt;?php bloginfo( &lsquo;charset&rsquo; ); ?&gt;&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&ldquo;viewport&rdquo; content=&ldquo;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&rdquo;&gt;
&lt;link rel=&ldquo;profile&rdquo; href=&quot;//gmpg.org/xfn/11&quot;&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p>With that change made, my Mastodon profile now looks like this:

			 <p>In the wake of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elon Musk closing a deal to buy Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (after trying and failing to back out due to buyer’s remorse), the scramble to explore alternatives reminds a little bit of the very early days of social media.  I’m old enough to remember social networking sites like Friendster and Orkut, and there were plenty of others I’ve forgotten who never gained critical mass and flamed out.  I joined Twitter in 2009, and over the past 13 years it has grown to become the social media platform I find the most valuable.  Having heard people mention Mastodon in the past as an open source Twitter alternative (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trump Social even tried to use the codebase without attribution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), I created an account—<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@genxjamerican@mastodon.cloud<!-- raw HTML omitted -->—to see how Mastodon compared for myself.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Six days before a local runoff election last year in Frisco, a prosperous and growing suburb of Dallas, Brandon Burden paced the stage of KingdomLife Church. The pastor told congregants that demonic spirits were operating through members of the City Council.</p>
<p>Grasping his Bible with both hands, Burden said God was working through his North Texas congregation to take the country back to its Christian roots. He lamented that he lacked jurisdiction over the state Capitol, where he had gone during the 2021 Texas legislative session to lobby for conservative priorities like expanded gun rights and a ban on abortion.</p>
<p>“But you know what I got jurisdiction over this morning is an election coming up on Saturday,” Burden told parishioners. “I got a candidate that God wants to win. I got a mayor that God wants to unseat. God wants to undo. God wants to shift the balance of power in our city. And I have jurisdiction over that this morning.”</p>
<p>What Burden said that day in May 2021 was a violation of a long-standing federal law barring churches and nonprofits from directly or indirectly participating in political campaigns, tax law experts told ProPublica and The Texas Tribune. Although the provision was mostly uncontroversial for decades after it passed in 1954, it has become a target for both evangelical churches and former President Donald Trump, who vowed to eliminate it.</p>
<p>Burden’s sermon is among those at 18 churches identified by the news organizations over the past two years that appeared to violate the Johnson Amendment, a measure named after its author, former President Lyndon B. Johnson. Some pastors have gone so far as to paint candidates they oppose as demonic.</p>
<p>At one point, churches fretted over losing their tax-exempt status for even unintentional missteps. But the IRS has largely abdicated its enforcement responsibilities as churches have become more brazen. In fact, the number of apparent violations found by ProPublica and the Tribune, and confirmed by three nonprofit tax law experts, are greater than the total number of churches the federal agency has investigated for intervening in political campaigns over the past decade, according to records obtained by the news organizations.</p>
<p>In response to questions, an IRS spokesperson said that the agency “cannot comment on, neither confirm nor deny, investigations in progress, completed in the past nor contemplated.” Asked about enforcement efforts over the past decade, the IRS pointed the news organizations to annual reports that do not contain such information.</p>
<p>Neither Burden nor KingdomLife responded to multiple interview requests or to emailed questions.</p>
<p>Trump’s opposition to the law banning political activity by nonprofits “has given some politically-minded evangelical leaders a sense that the Johnson Amendment just isn’t really an issue anymore, and that they can go ahead and campaign for or against candidates or positions from the pulpit,” said David Brockman, a scholar in religion and public policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.</p>
<p>Among the violations the newsrooms identified: In January, an Alaska pastor told his congregation that he was voting for a GOP candidate who is aiming to unseat <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, saying the challenger was the “only candidate for Senate that can flat-out preach.” During a May 15 sermon, a pastor in Rocklin, California, asked voters to get behind “a Christian conservative candidate” challenging Gov. Gavin Newsom. And in July, a New Mexico pastor called Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham “beyond evil” and “demonic” for supporting abortion access. He urged congregants to “vote her behind right out of office” and challenged the media to call him out for violating the Johnson Amendment.</p>
<p>Andrew Whitehead, a sociologist at the University of Indiana-Purdue, who studies Christian nationalism, said the ramping up of political activity by churches could further polarize the country. “It creates hurdles for a healthy, functioning, pluralistic democratic society,” he said. “It’s really hard to overcome.”</p>
<p>The Johnson Amendment does not prohibit churches from inviting political speakers or discussing positions that may seem partisan nor does it restrict voters from making faith-based decisions on who should represent them. But because donations to churches are tax-deductible and because churches don’t have to file financial disclosures with the IRS, without such a rule donors seeking to influence elections could go undetected, said Andrew Seidel, vice president of strategic communications for the advocacy group Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</p>
<p>“If you pair the ability to wade into partisan politics with a total absence of financial oversight and transparency, you’re essentially creating super PACs that are black holes,” Seidel said.</p>
<p>Churches have long balanced the tightrope of political involvement, and blatant violations have previously been rare. In the 1960s, the IRS investigated complaints that some churches abused their tax-exempt status by distributing literature that was hostile to the election of John F. Kennedy, the country’s first Catholic president. And in 2004, the federal agency audited All Saints Episcopal Church in California after a pastor gave an anti-war speech that imagined Jesus talking to presidential candidates George W. Bush and John Kerry. The pastor did not endorse a candidate but criticized the Iraq war.</p>
<p>Some conservative groups have argued that Black churches are more politically active than their white evangelical counterparts but are not as heavily scrutinized. During the 1984 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Rev. Jesse L. Jackson was accused of turning Sunday sermons into campaign rallies and using Black churches to raise funds. In response to allegations of illegal campaigning, Jackson said at the time that strict guidelines were followed and denied violating the law.</p>
<p>While some Black churches have crossed the line into political endorsements, the long legacy of political activism in these churches stands in sharp contrast to white evangelical churches, where some pastors argue devout Christians must take control of government positions, said Robert Wuthnow, the former director of the Princeton University Center for the Study of Religion.</p>
<p>Wuthnow said long-standing voter outreach efforts inside Black churches, such as Souls to the Polls, which encourages voting on Sundays after church services, largely stay within the boundaries of the law.</p>
<p>“The Black church has been so keenly aware of its marginalized position,” Wuthnow said. “The Black church, historically, was the one place where Black people could mobilize, could organize, could feel that they had some power at the local level. The white evangelical church has power. It’s in office. It’s always had power.”</p>
<p>At the end of his two-hour sermon that May, Burden asserted that his church had a God-given power to choose lawmakers, and he asked others to join him onstage to “secure the gate over the city.”</p>
<p>Burden and a handful of church members crouched down and held on to a rod, at times speaking in tongues. The pastor said intruders such as the mayor, who was not up for reelection last year but who supported one of the candidates in the race for City Council, would be denied access to the gates of the city.</p>
<p>“Now this is bold, but I’m going to say it because I felt it from the Lord. I felt the Lord say, ‘Revoke the mayor’s keys to this gate,’” Burden said. “No more do you have the key to the city. We revoke your key this morning, Mr. Mayor.</p>
<p>“We shut you out of the place of power,” Burden added. “The place of authority and influence.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Leading the probe was Rep. Gene Cox, a Georgia Democrat who had accused the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations, among others, of helping alleged Communists or Communist fronts. Cox died during the investigation, and the final report cleared the foundations of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>But a Republican member of the committee argued for additional scrutiny, and in July 1953, Congress established the House Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations. The committee focused heavily on liberal organizations, but it also investigated nonprofits such as the Facts Forum foundation, which was headed by Texas oilman H.L. Hunt, an ardent supporter of then-Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, a Republican who was best known for holding hearings to investigate suspected Communists.</p>
<p>In July 1954, Johnson, who was then a senator, proposed an amendment to the U.S. tax code that would strip nonprofits of their tax-exempt status for “intervening” in political campaigns. The amendment sailed through Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower.</p>
<p>Johnson never explained his intent. Opponents of the amendment, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as well as some academics<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, say Johnson was motivated by a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->desire to undercut conservative foundations<!-- raw HTML omitted --> such as the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government, founded by newspaper magnate Frank Gannett, which painted the Democrat as soft on communism and supported his opponent in the primary election. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Others have hypothesized<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that Johnson was hoping to head off a wider crackdown on nonprofit foundations.</p>
<p>Over the next 40 years, the IRS stripped a handful of religious nonprofits of their tax-exempt status. None were churches.</p>
<p>Then, just four days before the 1992 presidential election, Branch Ministries in New York ran two full-page ads in USA Today and The Washington Times urging voters to reject then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, in his challenge to Republican President George H.W. Bush.</p>
<p>The ads proclaimed: “Christian Beware. Do not put the economy ahead of the Ten Commandments.” They asserted that Clinton violated scripture by supporting “abortion on demand,” homosexuality and the distribution of condoms to teenagers in public schools. Clinton, the ads said, was “openly promoting policies that are in rebellion to God’s laws.”</p>
<p>The IRS revoked the church’s tax-exempt status, leading to a long legal battle that ended with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->U.S. appeals court siding with the federal agency<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The case remains the only publicly known example of the IRS revoking the tax-exempt status of a church because of its political activity in nearly 70 years. The Congressional Research Service said in 2012 that a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->second church had <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->lost its tax-exempt status, but that its identity “is not clear.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Citing an increase in allegations of church political activity leading up to the 2004 presidential election between incumbent Bush and Kerry, IRS officials created the Political Activities Compliance Initiative to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fast-track investigations<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Over the next four years, the committee investigated <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scores of churches<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, including <!-- raw HTML omitted -->80 for endorsing candidates<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the pulpit, according to IRS reports. But it did not revoke the tax-exempt status of any. Instead, the IRS mostly sent warning letters that agency officials said were effective in dissuading churches from continuing their political activity, asserting that there were no repeat offenders in that period.</p>
<p>In some cases, the IRS initiated audits of churches that could have led to financial penalties. It’s unclear how many did.</p>
<p>In January 2009, a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->federal court dismissed an audit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->into alleged financial improprieties at a Minnesota church whose pastor had supported the congressional campaign of former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Republican from Minnesota.</p>
<p>The court found that the IRS had not been following its own rules for a decade because it was tasked with notifying churches of their legal rights before any pending audits and was required to have an appropriately high-level official sign off on them. But a 1998 agency reorganization had eliminated the position, leaving lower IRS employees to initiate church investigations.</p>
<p>Following the ruling, the IRS suspended its investigations into church political activity for five years, according to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2015 Government Accountability Office report<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>During the hiatus, a conservative Christian initiative called Pulpit Freedom Sunday flourished. Pastors recorded themselves endorsing candidates or giving political sermons that they believed violated the Johnson Amendment and sent them to the IRS. The goal, according to participants, was to trigger <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a lawsuit that would lead to the prohibition being ruled unconstitutional<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The IRS never challenged participating churches, and the effort wound down without achieving its aim.</p>
<p>In response to a Freedom of Information Act request from ProPublica and the Tribune last year, the IRS produced a severely redacted spreadsheet indicating the agency had launched inquiries into 16 churches since 2011. IRS officials shielded the results of the probes, and they have declined to answer specific questions.</p>
<p>Despite the agency’s limited enforcement, Trump promised shortly after he took office that he would “totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.”</p>
<p>As president, Trump tried unsuccessfully to remove the restrictions on church politicking through a 2017 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->executive order<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The move was largely symbolic because it simply ordered the government not to punish churches differently than it would any other nonprofit, according to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->legal filing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by the Justice Department.</p>
<p>Eliminating the Johnson Amendment would require congressional or judicial action.</p>
<p>Although the IRS has not discussed its plans, it has taken procedural steps that would enable it to ramp up audits again if it chooses to.</p>
<p>In 2019, more than two decades after eliminating the high-level position needed to sign off on action against churches, the IRS designated the commissioner of the agency’s tax-exempt and government entities division as the “appropriate high-level Treasury official” with the power to initiate a church audit.</p>
<p>But Philip Hackney, a former IRS attorney and University of Pittsburgh tax law professor, said he doesn’t read too much into that. “I don’t see any reason to believe that the operation of the IRS has changed significantly.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Texas’ large evangelical population and history of activism in Black churches makes the state a focal point for debates over political activity, said Matthew Wilson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.</p>
<p>“Combine all of that with the increasing competitiveness of Texas elections, and it’s no surprise that more and more Texas churches are taking on a political role,” he said. “Texas is a perfect arena for widespread, religiously motivated political activism.”</p>
<p>The state also has a long history of politically minded pastors, Wuthnow said. Texas evangelical church leaders joined the fight in support of alcohol prohibition a century ago and spearheaded efforts to defeat Democrat Al Smith, the first Catholic to be nominated for president by a major party, in 1928. In the 1940s, evangelical fundamentalism began to grow in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p>
<p>Today, North Texas remains home to influential pastors such as Robert Jeffress, who leads the First Baptist megachurch in Dallas. Jeffress was one of Trump’s most fervent supporters, appearing at campaign events, defending him on television news shows and stating that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he “absolutely” did not regret supporting the former president<!-- raw HTML omitted --> after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.</p>
<p>Burden went a step further, urging followers to stock up on food and keep their guns loaded ahead of President Joe Biden’s inauguration. He told parishioners that “prophetic voices” had told him in 2016 that Trump would have eight consecutive years in office.</p>
<p>The Frisco Conservative Coalition board <!-- raw HTML omitted -->voted to suspend<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Burden as chair for 30 days after criticism about his remarks.</p>
<p>Burden called his comments “inartful” but claimed he was unfairly targeted for his views. “The establishment media is coming after me,” he said<!-- raw HTML omitted -->at the time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. “But it is not just about me. People of faith are under attack in this country.”</p>
<p>Since then, Burden has repeatedly preached that the church has been designated by the Lord to decide who should serve in public office and “take dominion” over Frisco.</p>
<p>As the runoff for the Frisco City Council approached last year, Burden supported Jennifer White, a local veterinarian. White had positioned herself as the conservative candidate in the nonpartisan race against Angelia Pelham, a Black human resources executive who had the backing of the Frisco mayor.</p>
<p>White said she wasn’t in attendance during the May 2021 sermon in which Burden called her the “candidate that God wants to win.” She said she does not believe pastors should endorse candidates from the pulpit, but she welcomed churches becoming more politically active.</p>
<p>“I think that the churches over the years have been a big pretty big disappointment to the candidates in that they won&rsquo;t take a political stance,” White said in an interview. “So I would love it if churches would go ahead and come out and actually discuss things like morality. Not a specific party, but at least make sure people know where the candidates stand on those issues. And how to vote based on that.”</p>
<p>Pelham’s husband, local pastor Dono Pelham, also made a statement that violated the Johnson Amendment by “indirectly intervening” in the campaign, said Ellen Aprill, an emerita tax law professor at Loyola Marymount Law School in Los Angeles</p>
<p>In May 2021, Pelham told his church that the race for a seat on the City Council had resulted in a runoff. He acknowledged that his church’s tax-exempt status prevented him from supporting candidates from the pulpit. Then, he added, “but you’ll get the message.”</p>
<p>“It’s been declared for the two candidates who received the most votes, one of which is my wife,” Pelham said. “That’s just facts. That’s just facts. That’s just facts. And so a runoff is coming and every vote counts. Be sure to vote.”</p>
<p>Pelham then asked the congregation: “How did I do? I did all right, didn’t I? You know I wanted to go a little further, but I didn’t do it.”</p>
<p>Angelia Pelham, who co-founded Life-Changing Faith Christian Fellowship in 2008 with her husband, said the couple tried to avoid violating the Johnson Amendment. Both disagreed that her husband’s mention of her candidacy was a violation.</p>
<p>“I think church and state should remain separate,” Angelia Pelham said in an interview, adding: “But I think there’s a lot of folks in the religious setting that just completely didn’t even consider the line. They erased it completely and lost sight of the Johnson Amendment.”</p>
<p>She declined to discuss Burden’s endorsement of her opponent.</p>
<p>In his sermon the morning after Pelham defeated his chosen candidate, Burden told parishioners that the church’s political involvement would continue.</p>
<p>“So you’re like, but you lost last night? No, we set the stage for the future,” he said, adding “God is uncovering the demonic structure that is in this region.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of the nearly 2,500 registered voters who were surveyed, 79% opposed getting rid of the Johnson Amendment. Only among Republican evangelical voters did a slight majority — 52% — favor loosening restrictions on church political activity.</p>
<p>But such endorsements are taking place across the country, with some pastors calling for a debate about the Johnson Amendment.</p>
<p>After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, New Mexico became an island of abortion access for women in Texas and other neighboring states.</p>
<p>The issue raised the stakes in the upcoming Nov. 8 New Mexico governor’s race between incumbent Lujan Grisham, a supporter of abortion rights, and Republican challenger Mark Ronchetti, who advocates limiting access.</p>
<p>“We’re going to fast become the No. 1 abortion place in all of America,” a pastor, Steve Smothermon, said during a July 10 sermon at Legacy Church in Albuquerque, which has an average weekly attendance of more than 10,000 people. Smotherman said the governor was “wicked and evil” and called her “a narcissist.”</p>
<p>“And people think, ‘Why do you say that?’ Because I truly believe it. In fact, she’s beyond evil. It’s demonic,” Smothermon said.</p>
<p>He later added: “Folks, when are we going to get appalled? When are we going to say, ‘Enough is enough’? When are we going to stop saying, ‘Well, you know, it’s a woman’s right to choose’? That’s such a lie.”</p>
<p>Church attendees had a stark choice in the upcoming election, Smothermon said. “We have the Wicked Witch of the North. Or you have Mark Ronchetti.”</p>
<p>The governor’s campaign declined to comment. Neither Legacy Church, Smothermon nor Ronchetti responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The sermon was a “clear violation” of the Johnson Amendment, said Sam Brunson, a Loyola University Chicago law professor. But Smothermon showed no fear of IRS enforcement.</p>
<p>Those who thought he crossed the line were “so stupid,” Smothermon said during the sermon. “You have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>In another example, pastors at a Fort Worth church named Mercy Culture have repeatedly endorsed candidates for local and statewide offices since its founding in 2019.</p>
<p>“Now, obviously, churches don’t endorse candidates, but my name is Landon and I’m a person before I’m a pastor. And as an individual, I endorse Nate Schatzline,” the lead pastor, Landon Schott, said in a February sermon about a church member who was running to fill an open state representative seat.</p>
<p>Johnson Amendment rules allow pastors to endorse in their individual capacity, as long as they are not at an official church function, which Schott was.</p>
<p>In other services, Schott challenged critics to complain to the IRS about the church’s support of political candidates and said he wasn’t worried about losing the church’s tax-exempt status.</p>
<p>“If you want it that bad, come and take it. And if you think that we will stop preaching the gospel, speaking truth over taxes, you got another thing coming for you,” Schott said in May.</p>
<p>Schatzline, a member of Mercy Culture, received 65% of the vote in a May 24 runoff against the former mayor of the Dallas suburb of Southlake. He works for a separate nonprofit founded by Heather Schott, a pastor at Mercy Culture and the wife of Landon Schott.</p>
<p>Schatzline said in an interview with ProPublica and the Tribune that Landon Schott, not the church, endorsed him. He added that the church sought legal advice on how to ensure that it was complying with the Johnson Amendment.</p>
<p>“I think prayers can manifest into anything that God wants them to, but I would say that the community rallying behind me as individuals definitely manifested into votes,” Schatzline said.</p>
<p>Mercy Culture also supported Tim O’Hare, a Republican running for Tarrant County judge, this year after he came out against the shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. His opponent in the primary had ordered churches and businesses to temporarily close when she was mayor of Fort Worth.</p>
<p>O’Hare came to prominence as the mayor of suburban Farmers Branch, where he championed a city ordinance to prohibit landlords from renting to immigrants without legal status. A federal <!-- raw HTML omitted -->court declared the ordinance unconstitutional<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in 2010 after a legal battle that cost the city $6.6 million.</p>
<p>O’Hare has pledged to hire an election integrity officer to oversee voting and “uncover election fraud.”</p>
<p>“The Lord spoke to me and said, ‘Begin to pray for righteous judges in our city,’” Heather Schott said during a Feb. 13 service. “I am believing that Mr. Tim O’Hare is an answered prayer of what we have been petitioning heaven for for the last year and a half.”</p>
<p>Neither Mercy Culture, Landon Schott nor Heather Schott responded to requests for comment. O’Hare also did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment.</p>
<p>Schott’s comments were a prohibited endorsement, said Aprill, the emerita tax law professor at Loyola Marymount Law School in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t say ‘vote for him’ but is still an endorsement,” she said. “There’s no other way to understand the statement that O’Hare has answered prayers for righteous judges.”</p>
<p>Two weeks later, O’Hare won his primary. He faces Deborah Peoples, a Democrat, on Nov. 8.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>“We’re not endorsing a candidate. We’re not doing that. But we just thought because they’re a member of the family of God, that you might want to know if someone in the family and this family of churches is running,” said Robert Morris, who leads the Gateway megachurch in Southlake and served as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->member of Trump’s evangelical advisory board<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>On the same day, Doug Page gave a similar message less than 5 miles away at First Baptist Grapevine.</p>
<p>“And so what we decided to do is look within our church families and say, ‘Who do we know that’s running for office?’ Now, let me clarify with you. This is not an endorsement by us. We are not endorsing anyone. However, if you’re part of a family, you’d like to know if Uncle Bill is running for office, right? And so that’s all we’re going to do is simply inform you.”</p>
<p>Saying that you are not endorsing a candidate “isn’t like a magic silver bullet that makes it so that you’re not endorsing them,” Brunson said.</p>
<p>The churches’ coordination on messaging across the area is notable, according to University of Notre Dame tax law professor Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, who said he hadn’t before seen churches organizing to share lists of candidates.</p>
<p>“I do think this strategy is new,” said Mayer, who has studied the Johnson Amendment for more than a decade. “I hadn’t heard of that before. It’s quite a sophisticated tactic.”</p>
<p>Eight of the nine candidates mentioned by the pastors won their races.</p>
<p>Mindy McClure, who ran for reelection to the Grapevine-Colleyville school board, said she thought church involvement contributed to her defeat in a June 5, 2021, runoff by about 4 percentage points. Her opponent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->campaigned on removing critical race theory<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from district curriculum, while McClure said students “weren’t being indoctrinated in any way, shape or form.” Critical race theory is a college-level academic theory that racism is embedded in legal systems.</p>
<p>McClure said pastors endorsing from the pulpit creates “divisiveness” in the community.</p>
<p>“Just because you attend a different church doesn’t mean that you’re more connected with God,” she said.</p>
<p>Lawrence Swicegood, executive director of Gateway Media, said this month that the church doesn’t endorse candidates but “inform(s) our church family of other church family members who are seeking office to serve our community.” Page told ProPublica and the Tribune that “these candidates were named for information only.”</p>
<p>Eleven days after responding to ProPublica and the Tribune in October, Morris once again told his church that he was not endorsing any candidates during the last Sunday sermon before early voting. Then, he again displayed the names of specific candidates on a screen and told parishioners to take screenshots with their cellphones.</p>
<p>“We must vote,” he said. “I think we have figured that out in America, that the Christians sat on the sidelines for too long. And then all of a sudden they started teaching our children some pretty mixed up things in the schools. And we had no one to blame but ourselves. So let’s not let that happen. Especially at midterms.”</p>

			 <p>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power finally debuted on Amazon Prime, and right on cue came the complaints from white fans of Lord of the Rings about &ldquo;wokeness&rdquo;.  What seems new about this latest iteration of the &ldquo;waiter, there&rsquo;s a [brown person] in my [fictional world]&rdquo; phenomenon is the deliberate decision of the mainstream media to legitimize these complaints about said fictional world.  The tweet below is a great summation of the journalist malpractice being engaged in here.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/carnage4life/status/1566399200329605120?s=21&amp;t=6I08T9JZouMjVoGJdCEj9Q">twitter.com/carnage4l&hellip;</a></p>
<p>When you lead off a piece with complaints about a fictional world with the deputy managing editor of redstate.com, that&rsquo;s bad enough.  But it&rsquo;s even worse when you conflate fans of Tolkien with actual scholars.  Running a story like this&ndash;which elevates the weakest of arguments from people with thin credentials at best&ndash;seems to be a preview of what we can expect from the new, &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; CNN.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written only briefly about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Star Wars being my earliest fandom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  But nearly as old as my Star Wars fandom is my love of The Lord of the Rings.  I came to it first through watching the Rankin/Bass version of The Hobbit in the early 80s, then the books.  The Lord of the Rings definitely contributed to my becoming a D&amp;D player later on (and a reader of many other books in the fantasy genre).  In college, I took the comparative mythology class taught by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dr. Verlyn Flieger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (a well-known Tolkien scholar) because it gave me an excuse to read The Silmarillion for credit instead of just for fun.  It&rsquo;s been nearly 30 years since I took her course, but I still remember it because to her credit she gave us what would later be called a trigger warning regarding the depictions of Gollum in Tolkien&rsquo;s work (which wasn&rsquo;t perceived as racist by many people then, but likely would be now).  I don&rsquo;t recall if she gave us a similar warning regarding the descriptions of orcs, but it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if she did.  N.K. Jemisin (the 1st and only sci-fi author to win 3 consecutive Hugo Awards for best novel in the genre) has definitely made that criticism of Tolkien&rsquo;s description of orcs.</p>
<p>When Peter Jackson&rsquo;s Lord of the Rings trilogy came out, my fellow Tolkien nerds and I made sure to see all three movies at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Uptown<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the best theater in the area at the time.  I bought and watched the extended editions of all three movies on DVD, and am overdue to add to my collection whatever 4K version of the trilogy my XBox One X will play.  I even watched the not-as-good Hobbit trilogy.  The books of the trilogy, The Silmarillion, and an old copy of The Tolkien Reader are on a shelf in the home office where I&rsquo;m writing this right now. I&rsquo;ve read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Children of Hurin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (a copy from the public library anyway), but have not yet added a copy to my collection.</p>
<p>Richard Newby is a longstanding member of the black Tolkien nerd tribe, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he&rsquo;s written the only piece worth reading on this subject.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  So rather than write an inferior version of what he&rsquo;s already written, I&rsquo;ll write more broadly&ndash;because these complaints from white fans aren&rsquo;t new.  Moses Ingram had to deal with these same people when they objected to her presence as an inquisitor in Obi-Wan Kenobi.  At least Disney (and her co-stars) seemed to have learned something from their failure to stand up for John Boyega when he first showed up as a black stormtrooper in The Force Awakens.  Disney failed Kelly-Marie Tran in a similar way.  Marvel has attracted much of anti-woke ire in recent years, for everything from Black Panther, to She-Hulk, The Eternals, and Ms. Marvel.  Steve Toussaint gets cast to play Corlys Velaryon&ndash;cue the anti-woke whining.  Now it&rsquo;s Sir Lenny Henry&rsquo;s turn, and Ismael Cruz Cordoba&rsquo;s turn to contend with toxic fandom.  Toxic fandom can suspend disbelief for magic, dragons, laser swords, faster-than-light travel, and time travel&ndash;but not for brown people&ndash;human, elven, dwarven, or harfoot in this case.  Even as I write, these sad know-nothings are arguing on Twitter about &ldquo;the author&rsquo;s vision&rdquo; with the likes of Neil Gaiman&ndash;who in addition to being a great and prolific fantasy author himself (American Gods, Anansi Boys, The Sandman, and countless others)&ndash;has such a deep knowledge of Tolkien&rsquo;s work that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christopher Tolkien personally thanked him<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for explaining a reference his father had written years before.</p>
<p>Before the internet, being a black fan of science fiction and fantasy was a lonely pastime.  Depending on where and when you grew up, you might not have had many other black kids as classmates at school or friends at church to begin with.  Add to that an interest that not many other kids might have and you had to be prepared to like or love that thing on your own.  You had to cultivate an appreciation for these stories despite the absence of characters like you playing parts in them at all (except as stereotypes and/or foils for whoever the hero was).  You don&rsquo;t realize that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing as a black fan of these genres (because you&rsquo;re in middle school when this starts, or younger), you only see it in retrospect when you&rsquo;re an adult.  I was most recently reminded of that mental work when I watched <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lovecraft Country<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and again when I rewatched the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Far Beyond the Stars<!-- raw HTML omitted --> episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a coincidence that these stories impact me the way they do, both set in the 1950s United States, when black people continued to be treated as second-class citizens at best.  Decades after these stories were set, self-appointed gatekeepers are still trying to keep us out of &ldquo;their&rdquo; genre&ndash;despite the fact that we know and love as well and as much, if not more than they do.</p>
<p>When I listened to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this episode of Throughline<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and heard how the work of Octavia Butler impacted&ndash;and still impacts&ndash;the life of an NPR co-host (who is originally from Iran), it reminded me of how thrilled I was to read Wild Seed and know that someone who looked like me had written it.  I only watched it in syndication, but still remember how important it was to see Nichelle Nichols play Lt. Uhura in the original Star Trek.  Seeing Billy Dee Williams play Lando Calrissian in The Empire Strikes Back, LeVar Burton and Michael Dorn play Geordi LaForge and Worf in Star Trek: The Next Generation, and Avery Brooks play Benjamin Sisko in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine really mattered&ndash;not just to my childhood, but into the present.  Deep Space Nine in particular has yet to equaled, much less surpassed in the genre, for its positive representations of black manhood, father-son relationships, even romance between a black man and black woman who are peers (Captains Sisko and Yates).</p>
<p>Today, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->N.K. Jemisin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nnedi Okorafor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tananarive Due<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Victor LaValle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and other black authors are putting out some of the best work on offer across the science fiction, fantasy, and horror genres.  Twitter hashtags like #DemDragons allow black fans of these shows to enjoy them together in near real-time.  Facebook groups and private chats (and their moderators) do the work of keeping toxic fans away.  And even when Hollywood makes mistakes, like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->firing Orlando Jones from American Gods<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->policing the language black writers use<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we are finally getting to see ourselves more and more in the work of this genre&ndash;and the work is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->better <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for it.  Studios and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fans are fighting back against bitter review bombers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  And while such defenses shouldn&rsquo;t have to be made, at least they are being made.  Toxic fandom may not like us in their fictional worlds anymore than their real ones, but we aren&rsquo;t going anywhere in either one.</p>

<p>Another excellent piece by Dr. Ted Johnson that makes sense of the disconnect between the voting patterns of black Americans and their personal views.  Johnson touches only briefly on the ways in which black distrust of medical and governmental institutions is informed by a long history of abuses visited upon black people by those same institutions.  It&rsquo;s bad enough that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->maternal mortality in the United States is among the worst in the developed world<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rate of maternal mortality in the US for black women<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is even worse.  The end of Roe v.

			 <p>A few days ago, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stephen Breyer announced his retirement<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the Supreme Court of the United States at the end of the current term.  Because Joe Biden pledged to nominate a black woman to the nation&rsquo;s highest court if he became president, he now has an opportunity to make good on that pledge.  Predictably, we began to hear and see a lot of high-minded (and hypocritical) commentary about how Biden should be choosing the &ldquo;most-qualified&rdquo; justice&ndash;regardless of their skin color.  Our attention span as a country is so short, we&rsquo;ve already forgotten that Trump&rsquo;s rise to the presidency was powered at least in part by publicizing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a Federalist Society-authored list of high court nominees<!-- raw HTML omitted --> he would choose from if the opportunity presented itself.  We&rsquo;ve already forgotten that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ronald Reagan promised to name a woman to the Supreme Court<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But the history of using the Supreme Court to accomplish social firsts stretches back much further than we might suppose from current commentary.  This <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thread by David Frum<!-- raw HTML omitted --> takes us all the way back to 1887, when President Grover Cleveland appointed Lucius Quintus Lamar to the high court in a bid to gain the support of conservative white southern Democrats for re-election.  Read Frum&rsquo;s thread in full to get a complete sense of how unrepentant a Confederate Mr. Lamar was.  This dubious social first&mdash;the appointment of a traitor to the Union to nation&rsquo;s highest court&ndash;would prove very important for a reason not fully touched on at all in Mr. Frum&rsquo;s thread.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1887 marked the year the US federal government fully abandoned Reconstruction<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash;and the nation&rsquo;s black citizens to decades of voter disenfranchisement, terrorism, property theft, murder, and Jim Crow laws.</p>
<p>No discussion of the Supreme Court and social firsts would be complete without mentioning Maryland&rsquo;s own <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thurgood Marshall<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  He earned his undergraduate and law degrees from 2 HBCUs (graduating 1st in his class from Howard Law because the University of Maryland School of Law was still segregated).  Out of 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court, Marshall won 29, losing just 3.  He served as a federal appeals court judge for the second circuit for a number of years prior to becoming the nation&rsquo;s first black solicitor general.  Some months of his tenure as an appeals court judge were served as a recess appointment due to certain southern senators holding up his official appointment, including the same segregationist James Eastland that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe Biden recalled a civil relationship with<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  He would win 14 cases on behalf of the government in that role, losing just 5.  Among his peers both at the time and since, there may not be a more successful justice at winning arguments before the Supreme Court prior to becoming a member of it.</p>
<p>Discussing the legal and rhetorical brilliance of Thurgood Marshall requires discussion of his successor.  Few nominations to the high court are a better demonstration of the hypocrisy of many of today&rsquo;s conservatives regarding &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo; (including those who oppose Trump) than the absence of such concerns being raised when Clarence Thomas was nominated to the Supreme Court.  In contrast to the years served as an appellate court judge and solicitor general by Marshall, Thomas was an appellate judge for the DC circuit for just 16 months.  Thomas graduated in the middle of his law school class at Yale in contrast to Marshall&rsquo;s 1st in class at Howard.  The White House and Senate Republicans apparently <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pressured the American Bar Association (ABA) to give Thomas a qualified rating<!-- raw HTML omitted --> even while attempting to discredit the ABA as partisan&ndash;and this is before Anita Hill&rsquo;s interview with the FBI was leaked to the press and led to the re-opening of Thomas' confirmation hearings.  The same GOP that loves to quote that one line from that one speech of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. could not have cared less about &ldquo;the content of [Thomas'] character&rdquo;.  They cared that he was both conservative and black.  The way the Senate treated Anita Hill during those re-opened confirmation hearings would in retrospect be a preview of the treatment awaiting future black women appointees to federal roles.</p>
<p>How Thomas fared during his confirmation hearings almost certainly animated the treatment of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lani Guinier after her nomination to become assistant attorney general for civil rights<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Republicans.  Her treatment by them, conservative media, and by the White House who nominated her was utterly shameful.  Conservatives lied about her positions.  The same Joe Biden who contributed to the poor treatment that Anita Hill received before the Senate Judiciary Committee he chaired 2 years earlier, reported &ldquo;grew lukewarm about Guinier&rdquo;.  President Clinton would ultimately withdraw the nomination in the face of lies and distortions about her writings.  His administration had apparently instructed her not to make any public statements about until after he&rsquo;d already decided to withdraw her nomination, enabling her opponents to smear her in the press and her &ldquo;allies&rdquo; to get cold feet about supporting her.  Particularly now as a wave of anti-CRT legislation, book bans, and attacks on affirmative action gain traction around the country (especially in light of Guinier&rsquo;s recent death), it is important to remember that Guinier only got to make her case to the public in one interview with Ted Koppel&ndash;and the public received her views well.  She never got the Senate hearing that even Robert Bork got for his extreme views because Bill Clinton&ndash;her friend from Yale Law School&ndash;pulled her nomination instead.</p>
<p>Not even two weeks have passed since <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the annual hypocrisy-fest that is MLK Day<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and a significant majority of Americans surveyed seem to have decided once again that black women should wait for what should be theirs.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1487917997574746113?s=20&amp;t=m4RvgM4DDavaXgWoGme01w">twitter.com/ABC/statu&hellip;</a></p>
<p>The attacks on the first black woman Supreme Court nominee will be fierce (if Biden follows through on his commitment).</p>
<p>When it comes to the Supreme Court and credentialism however, perhaps the best example of the double standard that seems to exist for women generally is the brief nomination of Harriet Miers.  Conservatives in particular dragged this woman for her lack of elite education (she earned degrees in mathematics and law at Southern Methodist University).  Only in looking back did I learn that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Harry Reid (Senate minority leader at the time) actually recommended Miers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as the successor to O&rsquo;Connor, and that other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee hoped to see nominees from outside the federal appellate court system.  Perhaps because Reid earned his law degree in George Washington University&rsquo;s part-time program, he didn&rsquo;t put as much stock in an Ivy League pedigree as he did in bringing the perspective of an experienced practicing lawyer to the Supreme Court.  Potential conflict of interest concerns raised by Miers' relationship with President Bush and his staff might ultimately have sunk her nomination anyway had she not withdrawn it.  By contrast, Clarence Thomas has ruled in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->numerous cases where he had clear conflicts of interest<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with little or no criticism from his supporters on the political right.</p>
<p>Considering the sorts of cases which will soon come before the Supreme Court, we should remember that as an institution it has been used as often as a tool to remove and restrict rights as it has to grant them (if not more so).  The aforementioned appointment of Lucius Lamar is not the only time that the Supreme Court has been used to undermine full citizenship for black people in the United States.  Before William Rehnquist became associate justice (nominated by Nixon), then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (nominated by Reagan), he was a &ldquo;poll watcher&rdquo; in Arizona under the auspices of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Operation Eagle Eye<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a nationwide campaign by the Republican National Committee to suppress black votes.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This 2021 piece by Charles Pierce<!-- raw HTML omitted --> makes a convincing argument Rehnquist tried to pass off his personal opposition to the ultimate outcome of Brown v Board of Education as that of the justice he clerked for (Robert Jackson, Jr).  In this memo, he defended <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plessy v Ferguson<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as good law, and likely lied about it in both of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings.  From the time he became one of Rehnquist&rsquo;s law clerks, to replacing him as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Roberts has had the Voting Rights Act in his sights<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a law to be weakened (if not destroyed).</p>
<p>Contrary to the polls (and numerous previous demonstrations of an utter lack of spine), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lindsey Graham has emerged as a supporter of the idea of a black woman nominee to the Supreme Court<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Current US District Court judge J. Michelle Childs of South Carolina being a possible nominee certainly doesn&rsquo;t hurt.  If <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the current shortlist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is any indication, any of the black women Biden selects from it will be just as qualified&ndash;and likely more so&ndash;than any of their colleagues at the time of their selection.  It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if Biden chose Breyer&rsquo;s former clerk (Ketanji Brown Jackson) to succeed him.  But as a state university graduate myself, part of me hopes that someone with at least one degree from outside the Ivy League gets selected.</p>

			 <p>The third Monday in January is here, and once again people who oppose everything Dr. King stood for are abusing the one line they know from the I Have a Dream Speech (because they don&rsquo;t know any others) for their own political ends.  This annual whitewashing of King&rsquo;s legacy only succeeds to the degree it has because the people doing the whitewashing don&rsquo;t dare venture beyond the confines of that line in that speech because too much of what he written stands in direct opposition to their political aims.  This applies not just to the secular, but to the religious as well.</p>
<p>One of my cousins read his children <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Letter from Birmingham Jail<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday.  This letter is where we can find the phrase &ldquo;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&rdquo;    This letter is also where we can find this phrase: &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  You can be certain that none of the hypocrites quoting King today will quote that.  Decades after this letter was written, we&rsquo;ve seen how this country continues to treat and talk about certain immigrants.  Decades after this letter was written, the segregation and police brutality of which King wrote in 1963 are still problems in this country today.  Actually reading his letter reveals that direct action was chosen as a last resort, only after the local leaders they negotiated with broke their promises.</p>
<p>This passage from the letter is sadly relevant once again in the wake of GOP measures to make it harder for those in the electorate who oppose their program to cast votes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An unjust law is a code inflicted upon a minority which that minority had no part in enacting or creating because it did not have the unhampered right to vote. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up the segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout the state of Alabama all types of conniving methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties without a single Negro registered to vote, despite the fact that the Negroes constitute a majority of the population. Can any law set up in such a state be considered democratically structured?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When you read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the letter written by eight Alabama clergyman that King was responding to, the motivation for this paragraph becomes crystal-clear:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&rsquo;s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, &ldquo;I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can&rsquo;t agree with your methods of direct action&rdquo;; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man&rsquo;s freedom; who lives by the myth of time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a &ldquo;more convenient season.&rdquo; Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>King&rsquo;s decades-old criticism of the contemporary Christian church in the America of his day should shame today&rsquo;s Christian church:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The contemporary church is so often a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. It is so often the arch supporter of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the church&rsquo;s often vocal sanction of things as they are.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If the church of today does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its authentic ring, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. I meet young people every day whose disappointment with the church has risen to outright disgust.</p>

<p>Thomas Homer-Dixon&rsquo;s piece mentions Christians just twice, once as fertile soil for the seeds of white nationalist great replacement theory to take root and flourish, and again as a group that would be super-empowered in a second Trump administration.  He projects a rise in violence by vigilante, paramilitary groups in the same sentence, though the use of Christian symbols and rhetoric by such groups has a history stretching back well over a century in the US.  The involvement of conservative Christian groups in the insurrection is much less-surprising however when you look back at their response to 9/11.  When surveyed in 2009 by the Pew Research Center, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a majority of white evangelical Protestants said that torture against terrorism suspects could <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sometimes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->often<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be justified<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  This belief was held both by majorities of Christians who attended church a few times a year or monthly, and those who attended church weekly&ndash;or more often.  Years after the original survey, you could even find a piece like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one in The Federalist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> quoting Bible passages and Thomas Aquinas to argue that Christians <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->support torture.</p>
<p>Not mentioned at all in the Homer-Dixon piece&ndash;significant increases in anti-Muslim sentiment in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.  The first murder victim of an anti-Muslim hate crime turned out to be a naturalized American citizen, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Balbir Singh Sodhi<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The turban he wore in adherence to the Sikh faith was sufficient cause for a bigot to murder him.  Anti-Muslim sentiment would later take the form of the birther conspiracy, for whom Donald Trump would become the most powerful cheerleader.  We have seen other anti-Muslim murders due to the ignorance of bigots (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->in Olathe, Kansas<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) as well as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->violent assaults.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> We&rsquo;ve also seen the political right <!-- raw HTML omitted -->demagogue Park51 into the &ldquo;Ground Zero mosque&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  That same year (2010) saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the introduction of anti-Sharia bills in a significant majority of our 50 states<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The number of conservative professed Christians who believed (and perhaps still believe) the birther conspiracy is in retrospect perhaps one explanation for the ease with which the QAnon conspiracy spread within the same community.  But looking back a bit further, that community&rsquo;s response to 9/11 might have revealed a predisposition to conspiracy theories more generally.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In 2006, a division of the denomination publishers for the Presbyterian Church published a 9/11 conspiracy book<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>There will certainly be more commentary about January 6th as this year progresses&ndash;particularly as more insurrectionists plead guilty to the crimes with which they&rsquo;re charged or (finally) face trial.  But the absence of a full reckoning with how this country&rsquo;s responses to 9/11 helped pave the way for 1/6 will prevent us from fully understanding that event&ndash;and might enable the next insurrection to succeed.</p>

			 <p>A friend shared the following tweet with me not long ago:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/meredith_jenOM/status/1425127590034092037?s=20">twitter.com/meredith_&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Whoever Jen Meredith is, she is hardly alone in sharing these sentiments.  Few routes to acceptance by the still-predominant culture in the United States are shorter and more reliable than implicit or explicit criticism of the black community in America whose heritage here stretches back even before the founding of the country as we know it.  There have always been people who buy into the model minority myth. The term “Asian” elides significant differences between its various subcultures (and erases the parts of that very large community which don’t support the immigrant success story in exactly the same way some white conservatives do).  People from the Philippines have meaningfully different backgrounds than those from South Korea, Pakistan, and Vietnam to take a few examples.</p>
<p>Meredith is (obviously) sub-tweeting American blacks with her entire comment, but the “no ethnic leader” part in particular betrays a very specific ignorance about the history of black people in the United States. Black people in this country have never just had one leader. Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. are just the ones that recent history (the vast majorities of which have not been written by black people) has acknowledged. Less often-noted are men like Marcus Garvey, who while Jamaican (not American) nevertheless found a receptive audience among some black Americans (including the parents of Malcolm X).  A. Philip Randolph was no less important than either of those men. The same can be said of Bayard Rustin, Fred Hampton, W.E.B Dubois, or Booker T. Washington.</p>
<p>Asians in the United States may not have had a singular figure that history chooses to recognize in this way (or a Cesar Chavez, like the Mexican-American community), but perhaps that’s in part because they haven’t really needed one. This doesn’t mean they haven’t even experienced racism in this country. The federal government passed laws against Chinese immigration and some were even lynched in California the way they did blacks in the South. Japanese-Americans were put in concentration camps and had their property taken. But at least they had property to take, which could not be said of black Americans in many cases.  One Asian-American experience which may not be broadly known, but is emblematic of the subtleties of racism in this country, is that of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Mississippi Delta Chinese<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The entire project is well-worth reading and listening to in full, but here is one part which stood out to me:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When your experience (and your parents' experience) of the United States doesn’t include the combination of chattel slavery, pogroms, property theft, terrorism, segregation, and other aspects of the black American experience, you’re bound to see this country differently. That’s why you can (unfortunately) hear some of the same anti-black American sentiments from black immigrants to this country. Particularly as someone who writes software for a living and leads teams of software engineers, I have more common experiences with my fellow church members, classmates, and co-workers from India, China, and the Philippines than I do with some black people with hundreds of years of heritage in this country.</p>
<p>Finally, it is exceedingly unwise to underestimate the growing political power of the Asian-American &amp; Pacific Islander community. This movement with “no ethnic leader” (as Meredith claims) got federal legislation passed against Asian hate crimes—in our current political environment—when we <!-- raw HTML omitted -->still<!-- raw HTML omitted --> don’t have a federal law against lynching after over a century of attempts to pass one.  It&rsquo;s all well and good to talk about having agency in one&rsquo;s life.  I am doing my best as a parent to teach my own children the same lessons about making good choices that my parents taught me.  But criticisms of the American black community that fail to acknowledge how an unjust society increases the difficulty of making wise choices are dishonest.</p>

			 <p>I’ve loved science fiction and fantasy for as long as I can remember. But I hadn’t thought much lately about exactly where that love began until a phone call from my mom today. She called to let me know that David Prouse had died. While James Earl Jones was the unforgettable voice of Darth Vader, David Prouse was who we all saw.</p>
<p>Before tonight’s conversation, where she reminisced about taking my sister and I to see it in the theater, I distinctly remember her taking me to see Return of the Jedi in the theater when I was 9.  I remember the anticipation of seeing and just how much I enjoyed it.  But when she mentioned my sister being in a stroller, I paused.  Because my sister and I are 4 1/2 years apart, she wasn’t talking about when we saw Return of the Jedi.  My mom was talking about the preceding movie—The Empire Strikes Back.  While I’ve seen it many times since then in almost every conceivable format save LaserDisc, I didn’t remember the very first time.  She thought I would be scared of Darth Vader, but as she told me I mostly stared in awe.</p>
<p>So Rest In Peace to David Prouse.  Thanks to you—and my mom—for starting my journey into science fiction.</p>

			 <p>Perhaps <!-- raw HTML omitted -->unlike most people of Jamaican or West Indian descent<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I was somewhat conflicted by Biden&rsquo;s selection of her to be his vice president.  During her presidential run, a lot of people focused on her responses to the questions about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->whether or not she smoked weed in college (and what music she listened to)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  What put me off about her response was not that she smoked, but that she used the Jamaican part of her heritage as an excuse to lean hard into a stereotype about the island and its people.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Her father apparently had a similar reaction<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Even without the bad weed joke, some of my conflict was regret that Colin Powell wasn&rsquo;t first.  I came of age politically at a time when his name was bandied about as a possible vice president and when he thought about running for president himself.  As a teenager, I was thrilled at the prospect that someone just like me&ndash;right down to both parents immigrating here from Jamaica&ndash;would run for president.  I even said at the time (and again in a recent family group chat) that I&rsquo;d have volunteered for a Colin Powell presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Despite my conflict, I wish the Biden-Harris ticket success.  They would give this country at least a chance to move toward its stated ideals.  And as for the commentary in some quarters regarding how insufferable Howard graduates will be, or AKA sorority sister will be, (or Jamaicans), I welcome that prospect.  Jamaica has always punched above its weight culturally.  A vice president of Jamaican descent would just be the latest example.</p>

			 <p>America still wrestles with names, symbols and statues.  But in the wake of George Floyd&rsquo;s murder, some of the nation&rsquo;s idols are falling faster than I can type.  Just today came news that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Princeton University is removing Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s name<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from their school of public policy and a residential college.  Woodrow Wilson famously screened the pro-Klan Birth of a Nation at the White House in 1915.  Earlier this week, the city council of Charleston, South Carolina voted unanimously to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->remove a statue of John C. Calhoun<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from their city square (and the removal work has already started, likely with a museum as its final destination).  In addition to serving as Vice President, Secretary of State, and senator, Calhoun was perhaps this country&rsquo;s most ardent defender of chattel slavery. The reckoning has even spread abroad, with protesters in Bristol, England pitching a statue of Edward Colston (a slave trader) into the harbor and Belgium beginning to remove statues of King Leopold II (brutal colonizer of the Congo).</p>
<p>Resistance to removing these men and certain symbols from places of honor still continues however.  While Mississippi has begun the process of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->considering a new state flag<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (minus the Confederate flag insert), the current flag still has its defenders. A bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest (whose Confederate troops massacred black soldiers who surrendered at Fort Pillow, and later led the Ku Klux Klan) still stands in the Tennessee state house after an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->11-5 vote against<!-- raw HTML omitted --> removing it in favor of another Tennessee historical figure.</p>
<p>Two things prompt my attempt to craft a dividing line (however imperfect) for honor:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam Serwer&rsquo;s defense of Grant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is reason enough that no state of Grant should ever be abused in such a fashion.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Professor Aderson Francois adds Grant&rsquo;s role in the Civil Rights Act of 1875,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and in a congressional commission that studied post-Civil War terrorism against black men and women in the South.</p>

			 <p>Today marks the date in 1865 when General Gordon Granger read General Order 3 to the people of Galveston Bay, Texas, informing the enslaved there and in all of Texas of freedom that had been rightfully theirs two years earlier.  That was essentially the full extent of my understanding of Juneteenth until recently, so I&rsquo;ve taken the additional time off my employer gave us today to dig a bit deeper.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Juneteenth.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Wikipedia entry about Juneteenth<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this explainer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. have been my starting points.  I shared these links with my direct reports as well as my co-workers before our 2PM close today, and was heartened by how generously they were received.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s national discussions of and writing about Juneteenth, the role of Texas and black Texans doesn&rsquo;t get nearly the prominence it should.  Even as someone who has read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Warmth of Other Suns<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the way that aspects of black southern culture migrated north and west out of the South along with its people, it didn&rsquo;t occur to me that holidays would or could migrate too.  Once I looked at the map of dates when different states granted it official recognition however, it made sense that Minnesota and Florida were among the first states outside of Texas to grant that recognition before the year 2000.  In reading a story <!-- raw HTML omitted -->like this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it reinforces yet again that we in this country are fundamentally miseducated about its history when it comes to the Civil War, Reconstruction, its failure, and the consequences of that failure.</p>
<p>Even a widely-acclaimed documentary like Ken Burns' <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Civil War<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash;which my high school classmates and I watched parts of in history class on VHS after each episode aired&ndash;can&rsquo;t convey just how determined some in this country were to preserve the institution of slavery.  Only in reading about Juneteenth did I learn of plantation owners and other slaveholders migrating to Texas and bringing those they enslaved along with them to escape the fighting (and leveraging their distance from Union troops to extract years of additional labor from them).  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This thread<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Aderson B. Francois, professor of law at Georgetown University, tells a story I definitely did not know about concerted efforts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to make it unconstitutional to abolish slavery<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Not only was the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Corwin Amendment<!-- raw HTML omitted --> passed by both houses of Congress by the necessary margin to proceed to ratification, not only did Abraham Lincoln support it, but my home state was among five that ratified it (and only rescinded that ratification in 2014).  Thanks to a friend I met back in grad school, I learned that some of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->defeated Confederates attempted to preserve the Confederacy in Brazil<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Spending the time to learn more about Juneteenth has unearthed quite a few things done in previous years to focus attention on it, and the story of black people in this country more generally.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This interview with Isabel Wilkerson<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from 2017 leads off with audio from the 1940s housed at the Library of Congress from a formerly-enslaved woman old enough to remember the original Juneteenth, and reflects upon the death of Philando Castile at the hands of police in the previous year.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the National Museum of African American History and Culture website talks about the legacy of Juneteenth.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A brief story from The History Channel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> originally published in 2015 talks about the Emancipation Proclamation and Juneteenth.  I&rsquo;m not sure how many other holidays have their own flag, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Juneteenth does<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and has for over 20 years.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing Juneteenth has done in the wake of George Floyd&rsquo;s murder is spark good faith questions from white friends and co-workers about aspects of black history in the United States.  While my heritage makes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my connection to the term &ldquo;black&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> more complicated, I refer friends to documentaries like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->13th<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and to the scholarship of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dr. William Darity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to learn more about reparations.</p>
<p>In addition to spending at least a part of today learning more, I donated to two non-profits and encouraged friends to do so as well.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Innocence Project<!-- raw HTML omitted --> works to free those wrongly convicted of crimes.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Equal Justice Initiative<!-- raw HTML omitted --> operates The Legacy Museum and The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which seek to educate about the history of enslavement, lynching, and mass incarceration of black Americans in the United States.  Perhaps this Juneteenth will be the beginning of an annual tradition of learning and contributing to the cause of justice.</p>

			 <p>A friend on Twitter asked the following question:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That combined with incompetently led governments both at the federal level and in some states are why the United States finds itself leading the way in the number of [novel] coronavirus cases.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Even as the total of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->coronavirus cases worldwide has exceeded 1 million<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (as of April 2, 2020), it&rsquo;s too easy to find people trying to use the pandemic in favor of their preferred ideology and against others.  From my vantage point, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->no<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ideology is faring particularly well against coronavirus.  Most of the countries at the top of the charts for total cases and new cases are democracies, but the top 10 also includes China (communist), the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Turkey (effectively a dictatorship).</p>
<p>What the coronavirus is highlighting (in addition to the problem of allowing the profit motive to take primacy in healthcare) is the importance of competent government&ndash;regardless of what ideology they claim or operate under.  Many articles (including <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) have pointed out that South Korea and the United States reported their first positive COVID-19 case on the same day.  The differing results of their responses couldn&rsquo;t be more stark.  South Korea has a tiny fraction of COVID-19 deaths compared to the United States, and a very low number of new cases.</p>

<p>I remember having a good, long laugh about this particular image when one of my cousins shared it on Facebook awhile back.  It reminds me that my parents were right about me being Jamaican, even though I was born and raised in America.  When I became a dad, among the many parenting things I did (and still do) was baths.  And while I was washing the twins (moreso when they were smaller than now), I would find myself calling out their body parts in patois as I washed them.  &ldquo;Come mek me wash your neck back&rdquo;, and so on.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, I made no effort at all to speak patois&ndash;not even when we were in Jamaica visiting for weeks at a time.  I even teased my younger sister for her attempts.  But now the joke&rsquo;s on me&ndash;in more ways than one.  The patois that sneaks out when I&rsquo;m not even thinking about it isn&rsquo;t the only way the heritage is more firmly embedded than I realized in my youth.</p>

			 <p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’re aware that Virginia’s Democratic Party has been trying and failing to navigate a controversy about blackface because both the governor and the attorney general of the state were found to (or confessed to) having donned blackface in the past.  I mention this only to provide some context for a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Coleman Hughes piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I was sent by a conservative friend of mine.  It may indicate something about the quality of the argument that it is written by a black undergraduate philosophy major at Columbia University instead of by any number of black conservatives with more of a track record.  But this 40-something graduate of a state university is going to share some of the ways in which Coleman Hughes’ opinion is not merely weak, but dishonest.</p>
<p>Strike one against this piece: he winds the clock back to last year to remind the reader of Megyn Kelly’s brush with blackface, and the resulting cancellation of her show.  Omitted from Hughes’ history is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Megyn Kelly’s long history of racist comments<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with her prior employer, Fox.  There’s also her regular practice of bringing on racist ex-cop Mark Fuhrman as a guest to comment on various issues.  Despite this history, NBC not only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hired her anyway<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but gave her the timeslot held by two black anchors (Al Roker and Tamron Hall).  What really prompted NBC to cancel her show was a decision that the blowback they were receiving from their own staff wasn’t worth it, due to the low ratings of her show.</p>
<p>Skipping past Hughes brief history of blackface, we get to the heart of his issue: a proposed zero-tolerance policy toward anyone who has ever worn blackface, and the way in which it would “thin out the supply of reputable public figures rather quickly”.  To make his point, he then rolls out a long list white actors and late-night personalities who have donned blackface for commercials, movies, or TV.  He names a few famous dead actors and actresses for good measure.  That’s strike two against this piece.  It’s a complete dodge of the issue at hand (which is the past racist behavior of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->elected officials, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and what consequences if any should result), and a transparently obvious dig not just at the left, but the “Hollywood left”.</p>
<p>Having chosen Bouie’s argument as representative, Hughes presumes to knock it down with this: “Anyone uncomfortable with the liquidation of much of America’s artistic class should reject the idea of a retroactive zero-tolerance policy toward blackface. Instead, we should take a more measured approach, one that, without minimizing the ugly legacy of minstrelsy, allows a modicum of mercy for the accused and accounts for the intentions of the transgressor.”  We’ll call this strike three, because as with seemingly anything involving redress of harm to black people in this country, the “more measured approach” is already regularly-applied–and the way blackface is treated will be no different.</p>
<p>Even as I write this, Northam remains in office, attempts to shame him into resigning having failed.  He is still deploying what others have called “the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shaggy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> defense”, saying he wasn’t the person in blackface <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the person in the Klan hood and robe.  He’s even attempted to pivot to making some sort of racial reconciliation the theme of his remaining years in office.  That effort is off to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->poor start<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, since he made the obvious mistake of calling enslaved Africans “indentured servants” before being corrected by his black interviewer, Gayle King.  Mark Herring remains in office as well.</p>
<p>A fourth strike for the piece’s omission of Republicans from among the “professionally offended”.  Despite being a party with a candidate for multiple statewide offices in Virginia who campaigned on preserving Confederate monuments, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a state senate majority leader who edited a yearbook at Virginia Military Institute chock full of racist photos and slurs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, this same party (to say nothing of the President of the United States) had the audacity to call for the resignations of Northam, Justin Fairfax (the lieutenant governor facing 2 allegations of sexual assault), and Mark Herring (the attorney general).</p>
<p>Hughes quotes Bayard Rustin at length in advocating for his “more measured approach” to those who demonstrated sufficiently poor judgment to think blackface an appropriate thing to do.  Rustin is worth quoting in full here:</p>
<p>“I think the time will come in the future when the Negro will be accepted into the social, economic, and political life of our country when it will no longer be dangerous to do this sort of thing, and then, of course, we would not be opposed to minstrels per se.”</p>
<p>If NBC executives felt sufficiently comfortable with throwing two black anchors out of their time slot in favor of a white woman with a history of making racist comments, how accepted are black people really in the social and economic life of our country?  If voters could replace the country’s only black president with the man who spent a majority of the preceding decade cheerleading for the birther movement, how accepted are black people really in the political life of our country?  With neighborhoods and schools re-segregating and supposedly-liberal northerners fighting the integration of their schools today, it seems we are a long way from a time when we can afford to tee-hee about minstrelsy.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A piece well-worth the time to read<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, regardless of your ideology.  I disagree with Dr. McWhorter’s characterization of anti-racism as religion (a critique made far more eloquently and convincingly by Dr. Glenn Loury) as overly simplistic.  As the eldest child of immigrants who came to the U.S. from Jamaica in 1969, my chief objection to the piece is my parents’ generation being held up as examples that anti-black racism wasn’t sufficiently onerous to prevent their success.  I see these examples held up often in conservative circles and they never seem to go beneath the surface.</p>
<p>McWhorter (and others) severely underestimate the degree to which having immigrant parents is an advantage–not just in terms of different expectations, worldview, and culture, but because of the absence of baggage tied to the country’s history. The mantra he blithely refers to in the beginning of that paragraph is one I only recall hearing once or twice in the 24 years I lived at home before moving out–and only in jest, not seriously.  Black people whose parents and grandparents were born in the United States almost certainly remember a time when that mantra was also a lived experience.  Interestingly enough, the very piece McWhorter links to says the following:</p>
<p>“While U.S. born blacks have had to battle generations of institutional racism, such as predatory lending, that has put them at a socioeconomic and psychological disadvantage that some immigrants have not experienced in this country.“</p>
<p>That shortcoming aside, McWhorter is making a good faith argument.  His desire is for meaningful action on the part of progressives to improve the lives of black Americans.  While I’m not a fan of the term “virtue signaling” (it’s a pejorative often found in the mouths of conservatives making bad-faith arguments), McWhorter is right in describing what one might call “performative activism” as a dead end.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what took so long for the “broad political left” to conclude that Trump is a racist.  Before he even ran for president, there was his cheerleading for the birther conspiracy, his insistence on the guilt of the Central Park Five despite their exoneration by DNA evidence, derogatory comments about Native Americans (back in the 90s when their casinos were competition for his), and being sued (along with his father) by the Department of Justice in the 1970s for discriminating against blacks in housing.  It should also be noted that quite a bit of the so-called mainstream media still uses euphemisms to characterize Trump’s behavior.</p>
<p>From this point forward however, Ms. Gray seems to be playing a game.  On the one hand, there’s a subtle criticism of The Daily Beast for not publishing the full context of Sanders’ remark.  On the other, a concession that “Sanders’s comment didn’t make much sense”.  Finally, she tries to rationalize Sanders’ statement by comparing with those of other politicians.</p>
<p>This game doesn’t work because unlike Gillum, McCain, O’Rourke, or Obama, Sanders gave white voters who didn’t vote for black candidates solely because of their race an excuse.  He renamed their rationale as “[feeling] uncomfortable” when even the author of this piece concedes it is racist by definition.  Sanders engaged in what many in the supposedly-liberal mainstream media have done for the better part of 2 years since Trump’s election–find some reason (any reason at all) for Trump’s victory that didn’t involve racism.  Many column inches were written about economic anxiety, fear of change, change happening too quickly, etc.  How could it be that people who voted for Obama would vote for Trump, some pieces asked (not mentioning, or purposely ignoring the outcome of the midterm election after Obama’s re-election).</p>
<p>To be fair, the author of this piece is correct in describing the ways that racism is exploited by politicians from both parties.  Even in this election cycle, the candidates of color and women who won the nomination of the Democratic party (and the general election as well in some cases) for various seats across the country (New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Minnesota are just some examples) often had to beat the party establishment’s choice to do so.</p>
<p>It is one thing to argue that you shouldn’t label people as “deplorables” or “racists” even if they are.  it is quite another to essentially argue that it was ok for Sanders to equivocate because it will gain him necessary white votes in 2020 if and when he runs for president again. The sad truth is that assertions of what type of candidates “the country is ready for” continue to be driven by those with the most backward beliefs and attitudes because too many in the majority who aren’t racist, misogynist, or xenophobic are either silent, or willing to equivocate like Sanders did.  Perhaps the challenges to these old and tired stereotypes need to come from the people instead of politicians.</p>

<p>The link above is Andrew Sullivan’s latest diary entry for New York Magazine (his regular gig since “unretiring” from blogging).  Any analysis of this piece must begin with the picture that precedes the first word.  Behind Trump stand Mike Pence, the current vice president, and Paul Ryan, the current speaker of the House and 2012 vice presidential candidate on Mitt Romney’s ticket.  Any column that purports to discuss the need for a healthy conservatism and fails to even name two of Trump’s key enablers–both long-time members of the mainstream conservative movement–is already falling short of its purported goal.  There is no mention of either man in Sullivan’s column.</p>
<p>Instead, Sullivan puts forward the things he is for as a conservative, and references a book by Roger Scruton that he feels defines conservatism well.  While he references a few of the ideals and people I typically hear from other conservative thinkers, what Sullivan ultimately describes as conservatism is ideal mostly disconnected from both history and its current political expression.  He attempts to separate the Republican Party from conservatism as well, as if a philosophy of how a state should function can realistically be separated from a party in power claiming to hold its ideals dear. But the most telling omission from Sullivan’s hagiographic treatment of conservatism is Barry Goldwater.  Only by not mentioning Goldwater at all can Sullivan allow his false equivalency instinct to take over and blame “the left” for putting his (false) ideal of conservatism under siege and resort to the same tired, pejorative use of the term “social justice” too common among conservatives to describe the advocacy efforts of the left for those who are neither white nor male.</p>
<p>After getting in his requisite dig at the left regarding their attacks on conservatism, I find it especially puzzling that Sullivan’s conservatism is supposedly “anguished when the criminal justice system loses legitimacy, because of embedded racism.”  I’ve seen precious little evidence that mainstream conservatism sees the criminal justice system as somehow illegitimate because of its disparate treatment of people of color.  Other conservatives, like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sohrab Ahmari<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Erin Dunne<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David French<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have publicly rethought certain positions regarding the criminal justice system in the aftermath of Botham Shem Jean’s senseless death at the hands of the police.  Sullivan doesn’t do that here.  Meanwhile, New Yorkers of color alone can point to the abuse of Abner Louima by the police (in 1997), the wrongful death of Patrick Dorismond at the hands of police (in 2000), the conditions of Rikers Island, and other aspects of the criminal justice system to question its legitimacy.</p>
<p>So-called mainstream conservatism is deathly ill precisely because it lacks sufficient diversity of race, class, gender, and faith both among its most high-profile advocates and its rank-and-file.  The small number of its advocates who are neither white nor male are given prominence only because they speak in favor of the status quo–not for a genuine equality.</p>
<p>Sullivan is correct in describing the degree to which the GOP is actively destroying what he sees as the tradition of mainstream conservatism.  They believe in tax cuts to the exclusion of all else–including fiscal solvency.  Their deregulatory fervor will result in an environment that will put our health at risk.  Their unstinting support of Trump lays bare the contempt the GOP has for the rule of law–unless it applies to those they dislike.  Which makes it all the more jarring when he writes: “I also believe we need to slow the pace of demographic and cultural change.”  Whether he intends the statement to do so or not, Sullivan gives aid and comfort not just to the immigration restrictionist, but to Stephen Miller and those like him who seek not to slow the pace of immigration but to reverse it.  When Sullivan writes that “the foreign-born population is at a proportion last seen in 1910″, he effectively endorses the arguments of Jeff Sessions, who spoke glowingly of a 1924 immigration law with the express purpose of keeping Asians, Africans, southern Europeans, and eastern Europeans out of the United States.  He can insist all he wants that seeking to slow the pace of immigration “is not inherently racist”, but when his arguments can’t be meaningfully distinguished from those of Jeff Sessions, he ought not be surprised when he’s not treated as arguing in good faith.</p>
<p>There might be something to the Sullivan argument regarding “elite indifference to mass immigration”, were it not for the fact of a Senate immigration passed with 68 votes in the recent past that didn’t become law because the GOP-controlled House refused to take it up (perhaps fearing it would pass).  No doubt some in the GOP want cheap, exploitable labor.  The Democrats may indeed encourage it because they think it will get them votes.  Neither of this changes the necessity of immigrants to our labor force.  There are plenty of difficult jobs Americans don’t want to do that immigrants will do.</p>
<p>The following passage of Sullivan’s latest diary is a fairly tight summary of straw man arguments and falsehoods:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sullivan’s idea that somehow a healthy conservatism would rescue the United States from the position it finds itself in is wishful thinking.  Without an honest reckoning with Barry Goldwater’s role in shaping what conservatism has become, and how easily the purported conservative party was taken over by Trump, mainstream conservatism will be fully and deservedly discredited.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve shared a few articles on Facebook regarding the now infamous &ldquo;manifesto&rdquo; (available in full <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) written by James Damore.  But I&rsquo;m (finally) writing my own response to it because being black makes me part of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a group even more poorly represented in computer science<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (to say nothing of other STEM fields) than women (though black women are even less represented in STEM fields).</p>
<p>One of my many disagreements with Damore&rsquo;s work (beyond its muddled and poorly written argument) is how heavily it leans on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->citations of very old studies<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Even if such old studies were relevant today, more current and relevant data debunks the citations Damore uses. To cite just two examples:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Particularly in the case of computing, the idea that women are somehow biologically less-suited for software development as a field is proven laughably false by simply looking at the history of computing as a field.  Before computers were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->electro-mechanical machines<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, they were actually human beings&ndash;often women. The movie <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hidden Figures<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dramatized the role of black women in the early successes of the manned space program, but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->many women were key to advances in computing both before and after that time<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Women authored foundational work in computerized algebra, wrote the first compiler, were key to the creation of Smalltalk (the first object-oriented programming language), helped pioneer information retrieval and natural language process, and much more.</p>
<p>My second major issue with the paper is its intellectual dishonesty.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Business Insider piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I linked earlier covers the logical fallacy at the core of Damore&rsquo;s argument very well.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This brilliant piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Dr. Cynthia Lee (computer science lecturer at Stanford) does it even better and finally touches directly on the topic I&rsquo;m headed to next: race.  Dr. Lee notes quite insightfully that Damore&rsquo;s citations on biological differences don&rsquo;t extend to summarizing race and IQ studies as an explanation for the lack of black software engineers (either at Google or industry-wide).  I think this was a conscious omission that enabled at least some in the press who you might expect to know better (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Brooks being one prominent example<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) to defend this memo to the point of saying the CEO should resign.</p>
<p>It is also notable that though Damore claims to &ldquo;value diversity and inclusion&rdquo;, he objects to every means that Google has in place to foster them.  His objections to programs that are race or gender-specific struck a particular nerve with me as a University of Maryland graduate who was attending the school when the federal courts ruled the Benjamin Banneker Scholarship could no longer be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exclusively for black students<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The University of Maryland had a long history of discrimination against blacks students (including Thurgood Marshall, most famously).  The courts ruled this way despite the specific history of the school (which kept blacks out of the law school until 1935 and the rest of the university until 1954.  In the light of that history, it should not be a surprise that you wouldn&rsquo;t need an entire hand to count the number of black graduates from the School of Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences in the winter of 1996 when I graduated.  There were only 2 or 3 black students, and I was one of them (and I&rsquo;m not certain the numbers would have improved much with a spring graduation).</p>
<p>It is rather telling how seldom preferences like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->legacy admissions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at elite universities (or the preferential treatment of the children of large donors) are singled out for the level of scrutiny and attack that affirmative action receives.  Damore and others of his ilk who attack such programs never consider how the K-12 education system of the United States, funded by property taxes, locks in the advantages of those who can afford to live in wealthy neighborhoods (and the disadvantages of those who live in poor neighborhoods) as a possible cause for the disparities in educational outcomes.</p>
<p>My third issue with Damore&rsquo;s memo is the assertion that Google&rsquo;s hiring practices can effectively lower the bar for &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; candidates.  I can say from my personal experience with at least parts of the interviewing processes at Google (as well as other major names in technology like Facebook and Amazon) that the bar to even get past the first round, much less be hired is extremely high.  They were, without question, the most challenging interviews of my career to date (19 years and counting). A related issue with representation (particularly of blacks and Hispanics) at major companies like these is the recruitment pipeline.  Companies (and people who were computer science undergrads with me who happen to be white) often argue that schools aren&rsquo;t producing enough black and Hispanic computer science graduates.  But <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very recent data<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the Department of Education seems to indicate that there are more such graduates than companies acknowledge. Furthermore, these companies all recruit from the same small pool of exclusive colleges and universities despite the much larger number of schools that turn out high quality computer science graduates on an annual basis (which may explain the multitude of social media apps coming out of Silicon Valley instead of applications that might meaningfully serve a broader demographic).</p>
<p>Finally, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as Yonatan Zunger<!-- raw HTML omitted --> said quite eloquently, Damore appears to not understand engineering.  Nothing of consequence involving software (or a combination of software and hardware) can be built successfully without collaboration.  The larger the project or product, the more necessary collaboration is.  Even the software engineering course that all University of Maryland computer science students take before they graduate requires you to work with a team to successfully complete the course.  Working effectively with others has been vital for every system I&rsquo;ve been part of delivering, either as a developer, systems analyst, dev lead or manager.</p>
<p>As long as I have worked in the IT industry, regardless of the size of the company, it is still notable when I&rsquo;m not the only black person on a technology staff.  It is even rarer to see someone who looks like me in a technical leadership or management role (and I&rsquo;ve been in those roles myself a mere 6 of my 19 years of working).  Damore and others would have us believe that this is somehow the just and natural order of things when nothing could be further from the truth.  If &ldquo;at-will employment&rdquo; means anything at all, it appears that Google was within its rights to terminate Damore&rsquo;s employment if certain elements of his memo violated the company code of conduct.  Whether or not Damore should have been fired will no doubt continue to be debated.  But from my perspective, the ideas in his memo are fairly easily disproven.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve held the title of development lead and development manager at different points in my technology career.  With the benefit of hindsight,  one of the roles advertised and titled as the latter was actually the former.  One key difference between the two roles boils down to how much of your time you spend writing code.  If you spend half or more your time writing code, you&rsquo;re a lead, even if your business cards have &ldquo;manager&rdquo; somewhere in the title.  If you spend significantly less than half your time writing code, then the &ldquo;manager&rdquo; in your title is true to your role.  When I compare my experience between the two organizations, the one that treats development lead and development manager as distinct roles with different responsibilities has been not only been a better work environment for me personally, but has been more successful at consistently delivering software that works as advertised.</p>
<p>A company can have any number of motivations for giving management responsibilities to lead developers.  The organization may believe that a single person can be effective both in managing people and in delivering production code.  They may have a corporate culture where only minimal amount of management is needed and developers are self-directed.  Perhaps their implementation of a flat organizational structure means that developers take on multiple tasks beyond development (not uncommon in startup environments).  If a reasonably-sized and established company gives lead and management responsibilities to an individual developer or developers however, it is also possible that there are budgetary motivations for that decision.  The budgetary motivation doesn&rsquo;t make a company bad (they&rsquo;re in business to make money after all).  It is a factor worth considering when deciding whether or not a company is good for you and your career goals.</p>
<p>Being a good lead developer is hard.  In addition to consistently delivering high-quality code, you need to be a good example and mentor to less-senior developers.  A good lead developer is a skilled troubleshooter (and guide to other team members in the resolution of technical problems). Depending on the organization, they may hold significant responsibility for application architecture. Being a good development manager is also hard.  Beyond the reporting tasks that are part of every management role, they&rsquo;re often responsible for removing any obstacles that are slowing or preventing the development team from doing work.  They also structure work and assign it in a way that contributes to timely delivery of functionality.  The best development managers play an active role in the professional growth of developers on their team, along with annual reviews.  Placing the responsibility for these two challenging roles on a single person creates a role that is incredibly demanding and stressful.  Unless you are superhuman, sooner or later your code quality, your effectiveness as a manager, or both will suffer.  That outcome isn&rsquo;t good for you, your direct reports, or the company you work for.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re in the market for a new career opportunity, understand what you&rsquo;re looking for.  If a development lead position is what you want, scrutinize the job description.  Ask the sort of questions that will make clear that a role being offered is truly a development lead position.  If you desire a development management position, look at the job description.  If hands-on development is half the role or more, it&rsquo;s really a development lead position.  If you&rsquo;re indeed superhuman (or feel the experience is too valuable to pass up), go for it.  Just be aware of the size of the challenge you&rsquo;re taking on and the distinct possibility of burnout.  If you&rsquo;re already in a job that was advertised as a management position but is actually a lead position, learn to delegate.  This will prove especially challenging if you&rsquo;re a skilled enough developer to have landed a lead role, but allowing individual team members to take on larger roles in development will create the bandwidth you need to spend time on the management aspects of your job.  Finally, if you&rsquo;re an employer staffing up a new development team or re-organizing existing technology staff, ensure the job descriptions for development lead and development manager are separate.  Whatever your software product, the end result will be better if you take this approach.</p>

			 <p>It seems the news has been rife with stories of security breaches lately.  As a past and present federal contractor, the OPM breach impacted me directly.  That and one other breach impacted my current client.  The lessons I took from these and earlier breaches were:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The availability of two-factor authentication has been growing (somewhat unevenly, but any growth is good), but it wasn&rsquo;t until I responded to a tweet from @felixsalmon asking about two-factor authentication that I discovered how loosely some people define two-factor authentication.  According to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this New York Times interactive piece<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, most U.S. banks offer two-factor authentication.  That statement can only be true if &ldquo;two-factor&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;any item in addition to a password&rdquo;.  By that loose standard, most banks do offer two-factor authentication because the majority of them will prompt you for an additional piece of &ldquo;out of wallet&rdquo; information if you attempt to log in from a device with an IP address they don&rsquo;t recognize.  Such out-of-wallet information could be a parent&rsquo;s middle name, your favorite food, the name of your first pet, or some other piece of information that only you know.  While it&rsquo;s better than nothing, I don&rsquo;t consider it true two-factor authentication because:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>True two-factor authentication requires a time-limited, randomly-generated piece of additional information that must be provided along with a username and password to gain access to a system.  Authentication applications like the ones provided by Google or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Authy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> provide a token (a 6-digit number) that is valid for 30-60 seconds.  Some systems provide this token via SMS so a specific application isn&rsquo;t required.  By this measure, the number of banks and financial institutions that support is quite a bit smaller.  One of the other responses to the @felixsalmon tweet was this helpful URL: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://twofactorauth.org/">https://twofactorauth.org/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The list covers a lot of ground, including domain registrars and cryptocurrencies, but might not cover the specific companies and financial institutions you work with.  In my case, the only financial institution I currently work with that offers true two-factor authentication is my credit union&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tower Federal Credit Union<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Hopefully every financial institution and company that holds our personal information will follow suit soon.</p>

			 <p>Until yesterday, I&rsquo;d been unaware that laptop batteries could fail in a way other than not holding a charge very well. According to the nice fellow at an Apple Genius Bar near my office, this happens occasionally.  I wish I&rsquo;d been aware of it sooner, so I might have gotten it replaced before AppleCare expired.  When I did some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->googling<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, &ldquo;occasionally&rdquo; turned out to be a lot more often than I expected.  Half-an-hour (and $129 later), a replacement battery made everything better.  The battery had expanded to the point that it was pushing on the trackpad and making it difficult to click&ndash;in addition to preventing the laptop from sitting flush on flat surfaces.  Now that it has a fresh battery (and even though it&rsquo;s only a late-2011 MacBook Pro), I&rsquo;m sort of tempted to replace it with a shinier new one.  My new employer is of the &ldquo;bring your own device&rdquo; variety, and the MacBook Pro is quite a lot of weight to schlep to and from the office every day.</p>

			 <p>I had an interesting conversation with a friend of mine (a computer science professor) and one of his students last week.  Beyond the basic which language(s) question were a couple more intriguing ones:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One thing that seemed apparent even in 1999 was that Java developers (the good ones anyway) had a great grasp of object-oriented design (the principles Michael Feathers would apply the acronym <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SOLID<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to).  In addition, quite a number of open source and commercial software products were being built in Java.  The same could not be said of C# until much later.</p>
<p>To the question of whether Microsoft will still be relevant in another ten years, I believe the answer is yes.  With Satya Nadella at the helm, Microsoft seems to be doubling-down on their efforts to maintain and expand their foothold in the enterprise space.  There are still tons of business of various sizes (not to mention state governments and the federal government) that view Microsoft as a familiar and safe choice both for COTS solutions and custom solutions.  So I expect it to remain possible to have a long and productive career writing software with the Microsoft platform and tools.</p>
<p>As more and more software is written for the web (and mobile browsers), whatever &ldquo;primary&rdquo; language a developer chooses (whether Java, C#, or something else altogether), they would be wise to learn JavaScript in significant depth.  One of the trends I noticed over the past couple of years of regularly attending .NET user groups, fewer and fewer of the talks had much to do with the intricacies and syntactic tricks of Microsoft-specific technologies like C# or LINQ.  There would be talks about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bootstrap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Knockout.js<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->node.js<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Angular<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and JavaScript.  Multiple presenters, including those who worked for Microsoft partners advocated quite effectively for us to learn these technologies in addition to what Microsoft put on the market in order to help us make the best, most flexible and responsive web applications we could.  Even if you&rsquo;re writing applications in PHP or Python, JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks are becoming a more significant part of the web every day.</p>
<p>One other language worth knowing is SQL.  While NoSQL databases seem to have a lot of buzz these days, the reality is that there is tons of structured, relational data in companies and governments of every size.  There are tons of applications that still remain to be written (not to mention the ones in active use and maintenance) that expose and manipulate data stored in Microsoft (or Sybase) SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and Postgresql.  Many of the so-called business intelligence projects and products today have a SQL database as one of any number of data sources.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best advice about learning programming languages comes from The Pragmatic Programmer:</p>

			 <p>This post is prompted by a couple of things: (1) a limitation in the Moq mocking framework, (2) a look back at a unit test I wrote nearly 3 years ago when I first arrived at my current company. While you can use Moq to create an instance of a concrete class, you can&rsquo;t set expectations on class members that aren&rsquo;t virtual. In the case of one of our domain entities, this made it impossible to implement automated tests one of our business rules&ndash;at least not without creating real versions of multiple dependencies (and thereby creating an integration test). Or so I (incorrectly) thought.</p>
<p>Our solution architect sent me an unit test example that used reflection to set the non-virtual properties in question so they could be used for testing. While the approach is a bit clunky when compared to the capabilities provided by Moq, it works. Here&rsquo;s some pseudo-code of an XUnit test that follows his model by using reflection to set a non-virtual property:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With the code above, if the business rule returned by RuleUnderTest looks at WorkflowStatus to determine whether or not the instance of SomeDomainEntity is valid, the value set via reflection will be what is returned. As an aside, the &ldquo;context&rdquo; returned from GetBusinessRuleContext is a mock configured to return sde if the business rule looks for it as part of its execution.</p>
<p>After seeing the previous unit test example (and a failing unit test on another branch of code), I was reminded of a unit test I wrote back in 2012 when I was getting up to speed with a new system. Based on the information I was given at the time, our value objects all needed to implement the IEquatable interface. Since we identified value objects with IValueObject (which was just a marker interface), using reflection and a bit of LINQ resulted in a test that would fail if any types implementing IValueObject did not also implement IEquatable. The test class is available <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you need similar functionality for your own purposes, changing the types reflected on is quite a simple matter.</p>

			 <p>One of the requirements I received for my current application was to select five percent of entities generated by another process for further review by an actual person. The requirement wasn&rsquo;t quite a request for a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->simple random sample<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (since the process generates entities one at a time instead of in batches), so the code I had to write needed to give each entity generated a five percent chance of being selected for further review.  In .NET, anything involving percentage chances means using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Random<!-- raw HTML omitted --> class in some way.  Because the class doesn&rsquo;t generate truly random numbers (it generates pseudo-random numbers), additional work is needed to make the outcomes more random.</p>
<p>The first part of my approach to making the outcomes more random was to simplify the five percent aspect of the requirement to a yes or no decision, where &ldquo;yes&rdquo; meant treat the entity normally and &ldquo;no&rdquo; meant select the entity for further review.  I modeled this as a collection of 100 boolean values with 95 true and five false.  I ended up using a for-loop to populate the boolean list with 95 true values.  Another option I considered was using Enumerable.Repeat (described in great detail in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), but apparently <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that operation is quite a bit slower<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I could have used Enumerable.Range instead, and may investigate the possibility later to see what advantages or disadvantages there are in performance and code clarity.</p>
<p>Having created the list of decisions, I needed to randomize their order.  To accomplish this, I used LINQ to sort the list by the value of newly-generated GUIDs:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
decisions.OrderBy(d =&gt; Guid.NewGuid()) //decisions is a list of bool<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>With a randomly-ordered list of decisions, the final step was to select a decision from a random location in the list.  For that, I turned to a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon Skeet post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that provided a provided a helper class (see the end of that post) for retrieving a thread-safe instance of Random to use for generating a pseudo-random value within the range of possible decisions.  The resulting code is as follows:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
return decisions.OrderBy(d =&gt; Guid.NewGuid()).ToArray()[RandomProvider.GetThreadRandom().Next(100)]; //decisions is a list of bool<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I used LINQPad to test my code and over multiple executions, I got between 3 and 6 &ldquo;no&rdquo; results.</p>

			 <p>One requirement I received for a recent ASP.NET MVC form implementation was that particular radio buttons be checked on the basis of other radio buttons being checked. Because it&rsquo;s a relatively simple form, I opted to fulfill the requirement with just jQuery instead of adding knockout.js as a dependency.</p>
<p>Our HTML helper for radio button lists is not much different than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  So the first task was to identify whether or not the radio button checked was the one that should trigger another action.  As has always been the case when grouping radio buttons in HTML, each radio button in the group shares the same name and differs by id and value.  The HTML looks kind of like this:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
@Html.RadioButtonListFor(m =&gt; m.Choice.Id, Model.Choice.Id, Model.ChoiceListItems)
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>where ChoiceListItems is a list of System.Web.Mvc.SelectListItem and the ids are strings.  The jQuery to see if a radio button in the group has been checked looks like this:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
$(&ldquo;input[name=&lsquo;Choice.Id&rsquo;]&quot;).change(function(){
&hellip;
}
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Having determined that a radio button in the group has been checked, we must be more specific and see if the checked radio button is the one that should trigger additional action. To accomplish this, the code snippet above is changed to the following:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
$(&ldquo;input[name=&lsquo;Choice.Id&rsquo;]&quot;).change(function(){
if($(&ldquo;input[name=&lsquo;Choice.Id&rsquo;]:checked&rdquo;).val() == &lsquo;@Model.SpecialChoiceId&rsquo;){
&hellip;
}
}
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The SpecialChoiceId value is retrieved from the database. It&rsquo;s one of the values used when building the ChoiceListItems collection mentioned earlier (so we know a match is possible). Now the only task that remains is to check the appropriate radio button in the second grouping. I used jQuery&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->multiple attribute selector<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for this task.  Here&rsquo;s the code:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
$(&ldquo;input[name=&lsquo;Choice.Id&rsquo;]&quot;).change(function(){
 if($(&ldquo;input[name=&lsquo;Choice.Id&rsquo;]:checked&rdquo;).val() == &lsquo;@Model.SpecialChoiceId&rsquo;){
  $(&ldquo;input[name=&lsquo;Choice2.Id&rsquo;][value='@Model.Choice2TriggerId']&quot;).prop(&lsquo;checked&rsquo;,true);
 }
}
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The first attribute filter selects the second radio button group, the second attribute filter selects the specific radio button, and prop(&lsquo;checked&rsquo;,true) adds the &lsquo;checked&rsquo; attribute to the HTML.  Like SpecialChoiceId, Choice2TriggerId is retrieved from the database (RavenDB in our specific case).</p>

			 <p>In the weeks since my last post, I&rsquo;ve been doing more client-side work and re-acquainting myself with ASP.NET MVC model binding.  The default model binder in ASP.NET MVC works extremely well.  In the applications I&rsquo;ve worked on over the past 2 1/2 years, there have been maybe a couple of instances where the default model binder didn&rsquo;t work the way I needed. The problems I&rsquo;ve encountered with model binding lately have had more to do with read-only scenarios where certain data still needs to be posted back.  In the Razor template, I&rsquo;ll have something like the following:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Nothing is wrong with the approach above if Name is a primitive (i.e. string).  But if I forgot that Name was a complex type (as I did on one occasion), the end result was that no name was persisted to our datastore (RavenDB) which meant that there was no data to bring back when the entity was retrieved.  The correct approach for leveraging the default model binder in such cases is this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since FirstName, LastName and Id are all primitives, the default model binder handles them appropriately and the data is persisted on postback.</p>

			 <p>One thing I initially missed about NUnit compared to XUnit (besides built-in support for it in tools like TeamCity) is attributes like SetUp and TestFixtureSetUp that enable you to decorate a method with variables that need to be set (or any other logic that needs to run) before each test or before all the tests in a test fixture.  When I first adopted test-driven development as a work practice, I felt it made things easier.  But the authors of NUnit eventually came to a different conclusion about those attributes, and implemented XUnit without those attributes as a result.</p>
<p>Rather than define attributes for per-test and per-fixture setup, the authors of XUnit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> recommend<!-- raw HTML omitted --> using a no-arg constructor where you&rsquo;d use SetUp and IUseFixture where you&rsquo;d use TestFixtureSetUp or TestFixtureTearDown.  While this took me some time to get used to, leveraging the interface made it easier to handle the external dependencies of code I needed to implement and test.  One technique I&rsquo;ve adopted to give myself additional flexibility in my test implementations is to add an extension point to the implementation of the SetFixture method</p>
<p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this example<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the extension point is a method named AdditionalFixtureConfiguration.  Calling it inside SetFixture ensures it will be called before each test class derived from UnitTestBase.  Making the method virtual and keeping it free of implementation means that I only need to override it if I need additional pre-test setup for particular test scenarios.  Because we use StructureMap as our IOC container, the equivalent of UnitTestFixture class in my example has a public attribute of type StructureMap.IContainer.  The AdditionalFixtureConfiguration method provides a natural home for any setup code needed to configure additional mappings between interfaces and implementations, set up mocks, and even inject mocks into the container if a concrete implementation isn&rsquo;t available (or isn&rsquo;t needed).</p>
<p>While this is the implementation I&rsquo;ve chosen, there are certainly other ways to accomplish the same thing.  Instead of defining AdditionalFixtureConfiguration in UnitTestBase, I could define it in UnitTestFixture instead and call it in every SetFixture implementation (or not , if that customization wasn&rsquo;t needed).  I prefer having the abstract class because it makes for simpler actual test code.</p>

			 <p>Important advice from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Pragmatic Programmer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (page 62):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since Apple introduced yet another language (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Swift<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WWDC<!-- raw HTML omitted --> earlier this week, I&rsquo;m starting to learn that language as well.  So far, the syntax is a lot easier to grasp than Objective-C.  The only real hassle with writing the code examples as I read the language guide is that XCode 6 Beta crashes every half hour.</p>
<p>With both languages (or any language really), the real leap forward comes from building something non-trivial with them.  Figuring out what that non-trivial something will be is another challenge altogether.  I wish there were a sites like codewars.com (or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Project Euler<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) that put out larger-scale problems intended to be solved with software.  Being part of the developer interview loop at work pushed me to create a few problems of that sort for use in interviewing developer candidates, but none of those exercises require more than 20 minutes of work. More significant challenges should make it useful to explore features beyond basic control flow and data structures.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week provided our office with an inconvenient lesson in what can happen when third-party dependencies break in unanticipated ways.  PostSharp is a key third-party dependency in the line of business web application we sell.  On the morning of May 20, our continuous integration server (we use TeamCity) began indicating a build failure with the following message:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Reading the entire explanation is worthwhile, but the key reason for the failure is this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are many lessons to be learned (or re-learned) from what we experienced with PostSharp, but I&rsquo;ll talk about three.  First, if a third-party dependency is critical to your application and has a licensing option that includes support, it is best to pay the money so that you have recourse if and when there&rsquo;s an issue.  On the Microsoft stack, this is proving increasing costly as more third-party .NET libraries and tools raise their prices (there are quite a few formerly free .NET tools that have been purchased by companies and re-released as rather costly closed-source software).</p>
<p>Second, whether or not there are licensing costs, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have more than one option for critical third-party dependencies. In the case of aspect-oriented programming on .NET, there are a number of alternatives to PostSharp. The vendor is even confident enough to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->list them on their website<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  So if licensing costs are significant enough a concern, it may be better to choose an open-source option that is less-convenient but gives you the ability to customize it than a paid option which doesn&rsquo;t (and yokes you to a specific vendor).</p>
<p>Third, It may make sense to avoid taking on a third-party dependency altogether.  When it comes to the Microsoft stack, it&rsquo;s likely that they offer a framework or API with at least some of the capabilities you need for your solution.  In the case of AOP, Microsoft offers Unity to support those capabilities.  Especially in the case where you&rsquo;re only considering the free tier of capabilities for a third-party dependency where Microsoft offers a product, if that free tier functionality isn&rsquo;t a significant improvement, it may be best to stick with the Microsoft option.</p>

<p>Before I joined my current company (back in 2012), before I even set foot onsite, there was a phone screen.  At the time, there seemed to be one developer responsible for phone screening every prospective developer candidate for the entire company.  If memory serves, the phone screen lasted around 45 minutes.  The questions were challenging, but not impossible to answer.  When the in-person interviews were scheduled, I had no idea what I was in for.  Over the course of 5 hours, I spoke to 7 different people who had some role in 2 or 3 different projects or products within the company.  The first hour, they put a laptop with Visual Studio in front of me and asked me to write a console app that performed three different tasks (I won&rsquo;t go into too much more detail as we still use the same exercise to this day).  I was able to complete the exercise with enough time to spare for my two interviewers to ask me questions about my solution (which while it worked correctly, was not the most elegant).  The rest of the interviews were all questions, some behavioral/team/&ldquo;fit&rdquo;-related, but mostly technical.  All the developer hires that came in after me presumably went through a similar process.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the fall of 2013&ndash;we&rsquo;ve won a contract that more than doubles the amount of work we need to deliver.  The pressure is on to find, hire and onboard as many good developers as we can find.  An interview process that works just fine when you only hire a new developer every month or two scales poorly when you have a month or two to hire a dozen developers.  So we involve more developers in the interview process and cast a wide net for prospective hires.  After spending many man-hours interviewing candidates who struggle with our programming exercises, we find a few external candidates to hire&ndash;but far less than the dozen we need.  We end up grabbing people from other teams within the company to compensate.</p>
<p>So when our company changed the process again to involve developers in the phone screen process, I did some Googling to find out what sort of questions make an effective phone screen.  By far, the most useful post I&rsquo;ve found is Steve Yegge&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Five Essential Phone-Screen Questions<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Reading (and re-reading) the whole thing is definitely worth your time.  Our recruiters only allot 30 minutes of time for our phone screens (and I usually have code to design &amp; write, or bugs to fix), so my phone screen generally only covers 3 of Yegge&rsquo;s 5 areas&ndash;coding, OO design and data structures.  In the coding area, instead of giving the candidates homework (or having them read the code over the phone), I started sharing a Google document with them and watching them write their answer to the coding question.  This is a great way to get a sense of how quickly a prospective developer hire can come up with a solution on the fly.  A more involved (and somewhat more buggy) approach, is to use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.NET Fiddle online console<!-- raw HTML omitted --> along with its collaboration feature.  If it doesn&rsquo;t crash on you during the interview, you&rsquo;ll be able to see if the solution compiles and runs successfully on the spot.  Thirty minutes has proven to be enough to get in a coding exercise and enough questions about OO design and data structures to have a good feel for whether or not it would be worthwhile to move someone on to the in-person interview phase of our process.  Since in-person interviews are generally conducted in pairs, each 30-minute phone screen that properly rejects a candidate saves 2-4 man-hours of additional interview time.</p>
<p>If there is any revision I would make to the current interview process, it would be to push our simpler questions into the candidate &ldquo;homework&rdquo; idea Yegge mentions early in his post.  Then we could preserve our 30 minutes of phone screen time for candidates who we already know have handled our easiest exercises.</p>

			 <p>Last week was the final monthly meeting of the Rockville .NET User Group  (aka <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RockNUG<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) after a seven-year run.  I greatly appreciate the leadership of Dean Fiala. It takes a lot of effort to find sponsors, meeting locations, and speakers consistently, and he always came through.  Fortunately, the name and domain will live on for future use in special events (like another <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robocode<!-- raw HTML omitted --> programming contest).</p>
<p>Being part of this group made an important impact on my career as a software developer in the DC metropolitan area.  I learned a ton from the different keynote speakers over the years.  The n00b talk portion of each monthly meeting gave me opportunities to present shorter talks of my own.  In these, I learned a lot from the research needed to give a good presentation and from the audience who received it (through their questions and other information they volunteered).  I&rsquo;ve met a number of friends in the industry through this group, and even recruited one of them to join me at my current employer.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since RockNUG first started.  For one thing, there are far more user groups now than there were 7 years ago.  This means a lot more competition to find speakers. The other change has been in web development on the Microsoft stack&ndash;it requires fewer Microsoft-exclusive technologies today than in the past. The increasing popularity of web applications and the success of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, jQuery, node.js, knockout.js (as well as languages like JavaScript) has broadened what those of us working in Microsoft shops need to know in order to be successful. So very few of the talks over the past couple of years have had a .NET-specific focus.  Finally, there is a lot of great learning material available on the web now. Between companies like Pluralsight, WintellectNOW, and conferences that post their keynote presentations online, there are a wealth of learning opportunities for developers that don&rsquo;t even require them to leave their desk.</p>
<p>None of these online options can replace the in-person interaction, networking and opportunities to build friendships that a user group like RockNUG can provide. So even though RockNUG has come to an end, I still believe in user groups. I&rsquo;ll be on the lookout for groups just like it (or perhaps even create one).</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Episode #980 of .NET Rocks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was an excellent 52 minutes on career management for developers.  Since turning 40 this year, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot more about my career and where I want to take it from here.  The entire episode is well-worth listening to, but I would distill the essence of the advice from the guest (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Sonmez<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) down to this: market yourself.</p>
<p>When I gave <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a talk to some software engineering students<!-- raw HTML omitted --> back in February, I encouraged them to start blogs, give presentations and talks, and start podcasts (so far I&rsquo;ve only done the first two myself).  I suggested all of these things primarily as a way for them to improve their knowledge, but a higher profile on the internet is certainly a positive side-effect of doing those things.  One point I didn&rsquo;t add (which Sonmez brings up in his interview) is that consistency is very important.  He recommends a blog post every week.  That&rsquo;s a goal I&rsquo;m striving to meet (though not always succeeding).</p>
<p>Another related point Sonmez made is that developers need to set aside regular time to manage their career.  The amount of time averaged something like an hour every two weeks.  Consistency is especially important here as well&ndash;if not mandatory, given how quickly technology advances.  I&rsquo;ve recently started reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Pragmatic Programmer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and it makes a similar point but uses investment terminology.  Section 5 of the first chapter (Your Knowledge Portfolio) make this point:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I saw this first-hand in an unexpected way when I attended South by Southwest in 2013.  One of the shuttle bus drivers I rode with regularly between my hotel and the various conference venues was actually doing it for income between short-term software development gigs all over the country.  He was an older gentleman whose skills (at least on the Microsoft stack) hadn&rsquo;t advanced beyond VB6.  While there are still a ton of software systems built in VB6 (I certainly built my share of them in the late 1990s and early 2000s), his knowledge portfolio means that contract work maintaining VB6 code may be all that&rsquo;s available to him.</p>
<p>In my own career, I&rsquo;ve been working to broaden my own knowledge portfolio beyond the Microsoft stack.  Microsoft itself is doing some of this by adopting external technologies like JavaScript, jQuery, and knockout.js for web application development.  Angular.js is a framework strongly supported by Google that Microsoft has made sure plays very well with ASP.NET MVC.  So building my knowledge of JavaScript, and platforms like node.js are also goals for me in doing what I can to remain an attractive candidate for hire&ndash;whether as an employee, or for a future of self-employment.</p>

			 <p>Today I encountered a task at work that offered the prospect of some pretty dull development work&ndash;code that needed to be written that was almost the same in multiple cases (but not quite).  It seemed like work that could benefit from the use of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T4 templates<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but quickly became frustrated by the process of setting up and debugging a template.  The interleaving of angle bracket markup with code was never fun in XML, and T4 templates began to resemble that very quickly.</p>
<p>So after abandoning the T4 template approach, I fired up <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LINQPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to see if I could accomplish my goal in that.  As it turned out, writing a small C# program in LINQPad for code generation was a lot easier.  I just needed to remember two key things about string substitution in verbatim string literals.  Here they are:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a code sample available as GitHub gist <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  So far, I&rsquo;ve used this technique to generate nearly 20 files in a fraction of the time it would have taken to write them manually.  Very little manual tweaking of the files was needed after generation, which left more time to test the generated code in real scenarios.</p>

			 <p>I inadvertently learned some new things about the .NET double struct while refactoring some code over the past couple of days.  A large set of test data we received recently revealed that we weren&rsquo;t correctly handling the following edge cases of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->body mass index<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (BMI) calculation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Incorrect handling of the second case caused an error as well.  But this time the BMI calculation returned the constant <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NaN<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Like PositiveInfinity, NaN has a static method to check for it (IsNaN).</p>
<p>Enough time has gone by (and enough code changes have taken place) since I first started this post back in September that I don&rsquo;t recall precisely what the original code did in the third case.  Under normal circumstances the BMI calculation would return zero, but our implementation returns the NaN constant if the BMI (or inputs to it) falls outside what are considered valid ranges.</p>

			 <p>Last night, I gave a talk at Towson University to a section of software engineering students (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->a friend of mine is their professor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  The goal of the talk was to share advice and experiences that would help them in their careers.  What follows is the notes I spoke from, with revised and extended remarks (indicated by [extra]).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overview<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Imagine being paid to test drive a car for 12 weeks.  That’s what an internship is—the only opportunity you may have in your working life to take a job and a company for a 12-week test drive.  You’ll get to see if you like the day-to-day of your particular role.  You’ll get to see if you like your boss, your co-workers, the culture of the organization.  When you are choosing your first real job, they can be a very useful filtering mechanism to determine which companies you should consider seriously and which ones you should skip.  If an internship works out really well, that company could give you your first full-time job.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If at all possible, don’t graduate without one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  A successful internship puts you ahead of recent college graduates without one because you have proof that you can do real work.</p>
<p>Internships are also a great opportunity to begin to build networks beyond your classmates.  Even if you’re a natural introvert, make an effort to be social.  You never know when a friendship might result in a reference, an interview, or a job—for you, or a friend you make.</p>
<p>I was an intern at The Washington Post the summer before I graduated from Maryland.  Halfway through the summer, they asked if I could return in the fall as a part-time employee and I accepted.  At the end of the year, the Post made an full-time offer for a help desk position.  I got better offers and took one of those instead, but I have no doubt it would have been much harder without that internship and part-time experience.</p>
<p>[extra] I said during the talk that all other factors being equal, the candidate with an internship wins over the candidate without one.  To be more complete, I should have said that a candidate with a lower GPA and an internship can and does beat a candidate with a higher GPA and no internship.  My undergraduate GPA was just shy of 3.0.  But because I had a successful internship, 4 months of part-time work experience at the same company, and a great reference from my boss, I had multiple offers before graduation.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Interviews<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When it comes to interviews, expect to be asked about anything and everything on your resume.  So if you can&rsquo;t back it up in an interview, don&rsquo;t put it on your resume.  I interview people for jobs on a regular basis, and always ask questions to find out if they really know all the things their resume claims.  If you have an internship under your belt, you’ll have real work experience to put on that resume.</p>
<p>Also expect to write code on the spot for a problem you’ll have had no advance notice of.  If you’re not asked to write it on a whiteboard, the interviewer may just put a laptop in front of you with an editor and wait for you to write it.  In interview situations like these, it’s very important that you verbalize what you’re thinking as you develop your solution to the problem.  If you stare at the whiteboard or the laptop for a long time without saying anything, the interviewer might think you’re stumped—even if that isn’t the case.  If you aren’t sure about some aspect of the question, it’s better to ask for clarification and be sure than to assume and be wrong.  I ask a simple LINQ problem in every interview—and nine times out of ten, the candidate gives the wrong answer because they assumed they knew what I was asking for instead of making sure.</p>
<p>[extra] The following is a version of the LINQ question I ask in interviews:
Given the following:
var listOfNumbers = new List&lt;int&gt;{3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36};</p>
<p>write the LINQ statement that returns every number in the list divisible by 12 and by 6.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Software engineering involves a lot of collaboration.  In my role, in order to develop a single feature or piece of functionality, there could be a handful of other people involved:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We’d all love to work on brand-new software, but most of us won’t get the chance.  It is highly likely that the first work you do will be maintenance of and/or enhancements to an existing system.  So developing an ability to find bugs in software (whether you originally wrote it or not) will be important to your success as a software engineer.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beyond Work<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Keep in touch, keep learning, keep your skills sharp (and add new ones).  That&rsquo;s a basic summary of the steps you need to take to go further in your career as a software engineer.</p>
<p>It is impossible to overestimate the importance of networking to your career (and I don’t just mean having a huge number of Facebook friends, Twitter followers, or LinkedIn connections).  By networking I mean staying in regular touch with people you’ve worked with in the past or know from school that you’ve enjoyed working with (and would like to work with again).  If you’re in the same geographical area, catch up with them in person once a year if you can manage it.  If you don’t live in the same area, go beyond a word or two on Facebook.  Don’t be the guy or girl who only checks in when they need something.</p>
<p>Having a strong one will not only bring you a wealth of useful advice and support when you need it, it will help you find work too.  A couple of examples from my own experience:
a. I worked with a guy named Dave at USWeb.  We worked together for a couple years before I left and the company folded.  We kept in touch off and on over the years, but hadn’t had regular contact in awhile.  Over 12 years after we actually worked together, he gets in touch because he’s looking for a job and trying to decide between two companies—the one where I currently work, and one I worked for previously.  I tell him my current company is better (not just trying to be a good company man, my former employer was terribly dysfunctional) and write up a referral for him.  He gets hired and over a year later he’s still having a great time.
b. Two other guys I worked with at USWeb—Murali and Allen.  One was director of technology, the other a senior developer.  I kept in fairly regular touch with Allen.  So after almost four years at Ciena, I’m looking for a change.  Murali, our former boss, is program manager at a local consulting firm and wants to surround himself with good people from previous gigs.  He contacts Allen first, but Allen likes where he is and isn’t looking to make a change.  But Allen gives Murali my contact information.  I interview, I get hired, I work there a couple of years before moving on to a management role at a different company.</p>
<p>Don’t pass up opportunities to expand your networks beyond classmates and people you’ve worked with in the past.  This area has plenty of software user groups.  They’ll have stand-alone website or be on meet up.com.  Join one.  Get to know people that regularly attend.  One of my current co-workers is someone I first met at a .NET user group in Rockville (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->RockNUG<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  A year-and-a-half later, when he got tired of commuting from Maryland to Virginia to work, we talked after a user group meeting about openings at my company.  He’s been there six months now and is doing great work for us.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Figure out how you learn best<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Some of us learn best through reading.  Some through lecture.  Some through examples.  Figure out which one of these you are and spend regular time outside of work learning however works best for you.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conferences and user groups provide great opportunities to network and learn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Smart companies use them to raise their profile and to recruit new talent.  The companies I consider the best ones in my career are the ones that sent at least some of their employees to a conference or training every year.  Even when I haven’t worked for companies that pay for employees to get training, I believe it’s important enough that I’ve paid my own way on more than one occasion for a particular conference.  I went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SXSW Interactive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> last year and met up with former co-workers I hadn’t seen in 10 years.  I met people from all over the world, as well as a few people who were literally across the parking lot from me.  Seriously!  I met a couple of programmers and a designer who work at a small firm in a building less than 100 yards away, but we had to fly over 1500 miles to meet.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogs, podcasts and screen-casts provide great learning opportunities as well.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  However you commute between home, school and work, it&rsquo;s time you could spend listening to one of the many podcasts available on technologies or software development.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Starting a blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great way to practice and improve your written communication.  I first started back in 2003, and my only purpose was to have a way to remember the process I went through to solve particular problems that I could access from wherever I wanted.  On occasion, I would get a comment or two from others on the web that helped me solve a problem I’d posted about or improved on a solution I’d come up with.  Sometimes a post has been useful to other developers than myself.  I’ve even gotten requests for help in the comments.  Once you have a blog, it also makes a handy place to publish a linkable copy of your resume.  That’s a piece of advice your professor gave me many years ago, and now   I have plenty of visibility to companies (and recruiters) without really having to bother with job boards.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Giving a talk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a great way to practice and improve your verbal communication.  User groups are always looking for people to come and speak, and if there’s a technology that you know well (or want to know well), having to give a talk about it in front of an audience is one way to give yourself an incentive to research it and learn it well enough to be able to answer questions about it.  I try to give a few talks every year to one of the user groups I attend in Rockville.</p>
<p>[extra] <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Starting a podcast <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is another option you might consider.  I listen regularly to a few podcasts by veteran software developers (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hanselminute<!-- raw HTML omitted -->s, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.NET Rocks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc) and learn a lot that way.  But I think we would also benefit from hearing software engineers who are relatively new to the work world, or even from interns.  In addition to creating opportunities to hone both your writing and speaking skills, you&rsquo;ll get to learn about audio and production.</p>
<p>With the amount of time you’ll spend working (and otherwise living your life), one of the habits that I&rsquo;ve personally found the most difficult to maintain is writing code regularly that isn&rsquo;t specifically for my job.  One of the benefits of school, especially in a computer science program, is courses where you have to learn multiple programming languages and produce working solutions in a relatively short period of time.  The diversity of languages is a great way to force yourself to think differently about how to solve a particular problem.  To the extent you make it a habit to learn a different programming language every year or two, the better your skills in your main programming language will become.</p>
<p>Music, martial arts, sports and medicine are endeavors that have practice built into them.  Software engineering doesn&rsquo;t.  We usually treat our work as our practice.  You will improve more quickly as a developer if you practice designing and building software <!-- raw HTML omitted -->separately<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the work you do everyday.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Practice!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  There are plenty of sites out there with different code katas (small problems that you write code to solve).  Larger, longer-term side projects are also a great idea—especially if they’re tied to a hobby or something else that interests you outside of your job.  In addition to these, the web is full of open source projects that could use contributors (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->github<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->codeplex<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sourceforge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc).  Try to contribute however you can—even if it’s documentation—and you’ll benefit from the experience.</p>
<p>[extra] When it comes to practice in improving your software engineering skills, it works best if you consistently increase the level of difficulty.  John Sonmez explains why <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  He also links to an incredible example by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jennifer Dewalt<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Programming contests (including things like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TopCoder<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) may be worth your consideration.</p>

			 <p>Barcelona is the first stop on our trip to Europe (hotels courtesy of my lovely wife, flights courtesy of me). In our first 36 hours here, we&rsquo;ve managed to recover from the change in time zones between DC and Barcelona, visit La Sagrada Familia, and visit Park Guell. Both were highly-recommended by the concierge at our hotel (Ritz-Carlton Barcelona, also known as Hotel Arts Barcelona).</p>
<p>Buying tickets ahead of time for La Sagrada Familia is highly-recommended also. We bought a tour with an English-speaking guide on ticketmaster.es for under 40 euros and probably saved ourselves 2-3 hours of waiting in line to get in. The guided portion of the tour was around an hour&ndash;the guide shared a wealth of historical information about the architect (Gaudi), the building, some of the sculptors, Catholicism, and the Bible itself. As someone who appreciates history and churches, the tour was excellent.</p>
<p>Park Guell was quite a bit of walking, but also fun. The monument zone of the park charges admission, which gives you access to some of Gaudi&rsquo;s interesting outdoor works (along with some shops and restrooms). Once you leave the monument zone however, you can&rsquo;t return without paying the same fee again. The best views of Barcelona are actually outside the monument zone anyway (if you don&rsquo;t mind climbing a lot of stairs).</p>
<p>We got to and from both attractions and our hotel by metered cab. Ride costs ranged between 8-12 euros. Only one of the four cab drivers we&rsquo;ve had so far spoke enough English for us to have a conversation.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll probably try the 1-day hop-on, hop-off bus and see as many attractions as we can.</p>

			 <p>Since the first time I posted a candied sweet potato recipe, I&rsquo;ve made it a few more times.  What follows is the 2013 version I made this past Thanksgiving (and will probably make for Christmas since family and in-laws have been asking):</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ingredients<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
4-5 lbs of sweet potatoes
1 20oz can of pineapple (preferably crushed)
1 1/2 cups of dark brown sugar
1 1/4 cup of unsalted butter
cinnamon, nutmeg, &amp; ground ginger to taste</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instructions<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
If you only have regular pineapple instead of crushed pineapple, slice it up into small pieces. Otherwise, skip to the rest of the instructions below.
Fill an 8qt pot 2/3rds of the way with water. Bring to a boil. Boil the sweet potatoes for around 15 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool for peeling and slicing later.</p>
<p>In a saucepan, melt the butter (over low heat), add the brown sugar and stir. Add cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger until the sauce tastes how you want it.</p>
<p>After you’ve peeled and sliced the sweet potatoes, lay down a layer of them, drizzle/smear on some of the sauce, and sprinkle on some of the pineapple. Repeat until you’ve filled whatever casserole dish or foil pan you’re using.</p>
<p>Bake this at 425 degrees for around 55-60 minutes.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last month, I presented on the topics of NuGet and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chocolatey<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RockNUG<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as the lead-in to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Makogon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;s Polyglot Persistence talk. Since the time I first gave a presentation on NuGet at a previous employer a couple years ago, the package manager has matured quite a bit. Because there was far more than 30 minutes worth of material to discuss, the rest of this post will cover material I didn&rsquo;t get to, commentary from the audience, and the answer to a question about tags.</p>
<p>In discussing the term package manager, I indicated that it meant more than one thing:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>NuGet enables us as developers to define and re-define what a third-party dependency is.  The team at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fortigent<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (one of RockNUG&rsquo;s sponsors) has made packages out of some of the functionality they&rsquo;ve developed internally.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways to create packages:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In addition to creating packages, NuGet gives us the ability to set up our own package feeds.  The feed can be a simple as a network share with packages in it.  One step up from that is to create an empty ASP.NET Web application and add NuGet.Server to it.  This will add everything to the application needed to host your own packages (or others from third parties).  You can even publish your packages to this type of application if you wish.  The pinnacle of NuGet package distribution is to host your own fork of the NuGet Gallery (available on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GitHub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  One software vendor, JetBrains, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->forked the NuGet Gallery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to publish documentation on all the plug-ins available for the latest version of ReSharper as well as make it possible to download ReSharper itself.  Chocolatey uses the NuGet Gallery code in a similar way.  Unlike the ReSharper gallery (which doesn&rsquo;t let you download plugins), the Chocolatey gallery does allow it (though the actual installs require command-line interaction, which is helpfully displayed next to each package).</p>
<p>One of the NuGet-related projects I found particularly interesting is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->concierge.nuget.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Its objective is to recommend NuGet packages in the same way we receive movie, music and product recommendations from Netflix, Spotify or Amazon.  Simply upload the packages.config file for your project and get recommendations back.  I learned about this (and other .NET development-related topics) on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Morning Brew<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Q &amp; A<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>While there weren&rsquo;t any questions at the end, there was one asked during the presentation about the &ldquo;tags&rdquo; element of the nuspec file inside each package.  When you look at a package in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NuGet Gallery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EntityFramework<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for example), you see a list of linkable tags.  Clicking on one actually triggers a search for each package that shares a particular tag.  So if  you&rsquo;re a package author who wants their package to be discovered more easily, putting the right keywords in the &ldquo;tags&rdquo; element will help.</p>

			 <p>Any new technical book has the challenge of adding value above and beyond what&rsquo;s available for free on the web.  A new book on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LINQPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has the additional challenge of adding value above and beyond the wealth of samples already included with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LINQPad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, including code samples from two <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LINQPad-enabled<!-- raw HTML omitted --> books.  So when I received my review copy of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Building Interactive Queries with LINQPad<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I was very curious to see what the author (Sebastien Finot) could accomplish in 126 pages.</p>
<p>Even as someone who has used LINQPad enough in the past few years to present on it on front of a .NET user group, I learned new things about the tool I hadn&rsquo;t known before (such as the ability to interact with the console and CSS customization of the application&rsquo;s look-and-feel).  The book might have been more accurately titled &ldquo;Building Interactive Queries with LINQ and LINQPad&rdquo;, as the book provided good examples of a wide variety for LINQs query operators.  Finot also mentioned the performance implications of ToList()&ndash;a very useful mention depending on the size of collection you might be dealing with in your queries.  All the code samples in the book are available for download as well.</p>
<p>The book missed some opportunities to add value for readers.  Fuller treatment of the NuGet dependency management capabilities in the paid versions of LINQPad would have been helpful in deciding if the feature was worth paying for.  Finot also mentioned the existence of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LINQ to Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LINQ to JSON<!-- raw HTML omitted --> APIs but didn&rsquo;t link to the projects in the book.  More examples of using LINQ to parse and manipulate JSON (instead of XML) would have improved the book significantly, given the increased usage of JSON in .NET development these days.  Unfortunately, the code samples didn&rsquo;t include databases, which would have enabled the author to go above and beyond the fairly standard Northwind database examples.  A custom OData feed for use in explaining the ability of LINQPad to query those data sources would have been a great help as well (given the rather tenuous availability of the sample services at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->odata.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>Building Interactive Queries with LINQPad is the only book I&rsquo;ve seen dealing specifically with LINQPad.  If you use LINQPad on a regular basis (or plan to), the e-book is worth purchasing.  For an in-depth treatment of LINQ, you&rsquo;ll have to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Disclosure: I received the e-book free of charge from the publisher for the purpose of providing this review.</p>

			 <p>Dealing with the fallout in failing unit tests from a code merge is one of the most frustrating tasks in software development.  And as one of a (very) small number of developers on our team that believes in unit testing, it fell to me to determine the cause of multiple instances of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->structuremap exception code 207<!-- raw HTML omitted --> error.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the culprit was a tactic I&rsquo;ve used in the past to work with code that only works with a specific version of an assembly&ndash;the binding redirect.  When the same person is in charge of upgrading dependencies, this tends not to be an issue because if they&rsquo;ve used binding redirects, they know it&rsquo;s necessary to update them when dependencies are upgraded.    In this case, the dependencies were upgraded and the redirects were not.  As a result, StructureMap tried to find a specific version of an assembly that was no longer available and threw exception code 207 when it failed.</p>

			 <p>I love word games.  Whether it&rsquo;s old-school ones like Scrabble and Boggle or the increasing number of iPhone word games (Words with Friends, Scramble with Friends, Letterpress, Ruzzle, etc), I play them all.  Our federal government is playing a different word game right now, by hesitating to describe the overthrow of the Morsi government in Egypt as a coup d' etat.</p>
<p>The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines <!-- raw HTML omitted -->coup d' etat<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this way:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So why won&rsquo;t our government call this change what it is?  Perhaps because the U.S. provides more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->foreign aid to Egypt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than to any other country except Israel for the purpose of preventing another shooting war between Egypt and Israel.  Perhaps because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a section<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 &ldquo;restricts assistance to the government of any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup or decree&rdquo;.  Whatever the reason, now that the Egyptian army has killed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->51 and injured hundreds<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in clashes yesterday, it&rsquo;s unclear how much longer the Washington word games can (or should) continue.</p>

			 <p>I came across<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> via Daring Fireball, and figured I&rsquo;d post my two cents about it.  I disagree with the both the premise of the article and some of the specifics.</p>
<p>To the question of &ldquo;why are so many of us so surprisingly cheap when browsing the virtual shelves of the App Store?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d say because quite a few vendors have conditioned us to expect high-quality apps for a fairly low price. It&rsquo;s the same reason that the vast majority of people expect news to be free on the Internet.  Those news sources that went online with paywalls at the beginning (The Wall Street Journal and The Economist are two publications I read for example) are still doing just fine financially.  Those that didn&rsquo;t are struggling financially (or going out of business altogether).</p>
<p>The idea that &ldquo;we as cheap customers are having a negative impact on a lot of both real and potential businesses&rdquo; is one I disagree with.  One, because the author doesn&rsquo;t quantify the negative impact.  Two, because a potential business is a valueless unknown (and as such, can&rsquo;t have any real weight in a discussion of what to pay for products from real companies).  I&rsquo;ll certainly buy an app if I use it a lot (and/or get tired of seeing ads in the case of most games).  The benefit of the low pricing both to us as consumers and to app developers is that we can buy multiple apps that do similar things without having to think much about the cost (it&rsquo;s why I own more than one photography app, for example).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of in-app purchases (especially after finding out how much my wife spent on a single game), but I don&rsquo;t see much of a difference between that model and the licensing/subscription model that more and more software companies (Adobe, Microsoft) and others (Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, Pandora) are moving (or have already moved) to.  The author&rsquo;s focus on social media apps and games leaves out more serious &ldquo;service-backed&rdquo; apps like Evernote, GitHub, Flickr, DropBox, Box, LinkedIn and Google Drive that let you use a limited set of functionality for free and pay more for additional features or storage space.</p>
<p>Companies who sell apps aren&rsquo;t doing it for charity.  So if they&rsquo;re any good at business at all, they&rsquo;ll sell their products at a price that will keep them in business&ndash;or they&rsquo;ll go out of business.  It isn&rsquo;t our job as consumers to keep poorly run companies in business by buying their software.  And despite the author&rsquo;s suggestion, paying for great apps now certainly doesn&rsquo;t mean great apps later.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t been to a conference so large (whether you&rsquo;re counting people or land area covered) since Microsoft&rsquo;s PDC in 2001&ndash;and that was held at Staples Center in Los Angeles.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sessions<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Even though I only attended Interactive (they have Music and Film too), there were a ton of choices of sessions across a wide variety of technical, creative and other disciplines.  In addition the technical topics I was looking for, I got to learn about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quantified self movement<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, 3-D printing, wearable computing and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Swag<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Between the vendors in the exhibit hall and all the companies there recruiting new people, I&rsquo;ve never gotten so much free stuff in my entire life.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Keynotes<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d attended keynote speeches at conferences before, but hadn&rsquo;t seen keynote interviews before.  Elon Musk and Al Gore were both entertaining and thought-provoking.  While it wasn&rsquo;t billed as a keynote, the best solo talk I heard during the entire conference was Phil Libin&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chaotic Good<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Panels<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Many sessions weren&rsquo;t just a single person speaking, but a group speaking in front of an audience.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Making it Rain in Non-Techy Markets<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the best panel I attended during the conference.  While I&rsquo;m not an entrepreneur (yet), all four panelists gave really helpful advice.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->People<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I met people from all over the world at this conference.  Just on the rides to and from the convention center each morning and evening I met people from the Netherlands, Australia and Italy&ndash;as well as from all over the U.S.  In the airport on the way back, I met 3 people from a company that happens to be across the parking lot from mine!</p>
<p>Quite a few people I met were founders or co-founders of their own companies.  I heard a number of start-up pitches and met a venture capitalist who was in town looking for companies to invest in.</p>
<p>The locals who were brave enough to stay in town for South By were very friendly and helpful.  One guy even gave a couple of us a ride to the convention center when our shuttle was running late.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Traffic<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Speaking of shuttles, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->R &amp; R Limousine and Bus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the exclusive shuttle provider between hotels and SXSW venues) did a pretty poor job serving my hotel (one of two close to the airport).  When we didn&rsquo;t resort to bumming rides from strangers or calling cabs, we usually ended up waiting a long time for our to show up.  The traffic did us no favors either.  Between the construction on the roads and street closures, it took a long time to get in and out of downtown.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>SXSW Interactive 2013 was a great (if tiring) time.  I really enjoyed Austin as a town.  It has a buzz, an energy to it unlike any city I&rsquo;ve ever visited.  I hope to go back&ndash;if not for SXSW 2014, then a different time of year to enjoy the rest of Austin.</p>

			 <p>I recently received the task of modifying an existing MSBuild script to copy configuration files from one location to another while preserving all but the top levels of their original folder structure.  Completing this task required a refresher in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MSBuild well-known metadata<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and task batching (among other things), so I&rsquo;m recounting my process here for future reference.</p>
<p>The config files that needed copying were already collected into an item via a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CreateItem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> task.  Since we&rsquo;re using MSBuild 4.0 though, I replaced it with the simpler <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ItemGroup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  CreateItem has been deprecated for awhile, but can still be used.  There is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a bit of debate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over the precise differences between CreateItem and ItemGroup, but for me the bottom line is the same (or superior) functionality with less XML.</p>
<p>Creating a new folder on the fly is easy enough with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MakeDir<!-- raw HTML omitted --> task.  There&rsquo;s no need to manually check whether or not the directory you&rsquo;re trying to create already exists or not.  The task just works.</p>
<p>The trickiest part of  this task was figuring out what combination of well-known metadata needed to go in the DestinationFiles attribute of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Copy <!-- raw HTML omitted -->task to achieve the desired result.  The answer ended up looking like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The key bit of metadata is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RecursiveDir<!-- raw HTML omitted --> part.  Since the ItemGroup that builds the file collection uses the ** wildcard, and it covered all the original folder structure I needed, putting after the new &ldquo;root&rdquo; destination and before the file names gave me the result I wanted.  Another reason that well-known metadata was vital to the task is that all the files have the same name (Web.config), so the easiest way to differentiate them for the purpose of copying was their location in the folder structure.</p>
<p>In addition to the links above, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this book<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sayed Ibrahim Hashimi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was very helpful.  In a previous job where configuration management was a much larger part of my role, I referred to it (and sedodream.com) on a daily basis.</p>

			 <p>One of the long-running annoyances we&rsquo;ve had with our test of AutoMapper configuration validity on my current project is that a test failure only revealed the first mapping that was wrong.  I haven&rsquo;t figured out why this is the case, but I&rsquo;ve come up with a work-around that displays all the necessary information.</p>
<p>Because the exception thrown if one or more incorrect mappings is found is AutoMapperConfigurationException, my revised test catches that exception in order to print the source type, destination type,  and the list of unmapped property names.  Re-throwing the exception at the end ensures that the test still reports a failure.  The XUnit test which demonstrates this is available as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a GitHub gist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  If you&rsquo;re using NUnit or MSTest in your application, minor revisions to this test will give you the same results.</p>

			 <p>After about two weeks of homelessness (a.k.a. living in my wife&rsquo;s condo and hotels), we finally completed the settlement process on our shiny new townhouse around 3 pm this afternoon.  Less than two hours later, we&rsquo;d spent some of the profit left over from the sale of my old townhouse on new furniture for the main level.  Between working full-time, preparing a house to sell, and buying a new one, the past four months have been incredibly busy.  It still won&rsquo;t be slowing down anytime soon.  Tomorrow is move-in day, since PODS is coming to pick up their storage unit at noon.  There&rsquo;s still Verizon FIOS to install, furniture deliveries to accept, more furniture and electronics to buy (not to mention a new washer and dryer).  I&rsquo;ll be glad when we&rsquo;re finally settled in so we can invite some friends to hang out.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our new neighborhood<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is still in the process of being built, but what we&rsquo;ve seen so far of where we&rsquo;ll be living looks great.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting to know our new neighbors.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->provocatively-titled book<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a couple of days ago. I expected Baratunde Thurston&rsquo;s memoir to have its funny moments (he worked for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Onion<!-- raw HTML omitted --> until recently) and it did. I was not expecting the deep insights about black identity I found throughout the book. I also wasn&rsquo;t expecting to see as much of myself in the author (beyond the unpleasant childhood experiences I had as a result of not fitting the stereotypes of what black kids are supposed to do and be). It was a pleasant surprise to discover that Thurston and I have Washington Post internships in common (as does my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one of the handful of other black computer scientists I know).</p>
<p>I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that Thurston&rsquo;s interest in technology was inspired (at least in part) by his mother, who made a living writing COBOL for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  One of the other technologists that blogs whom I admire greatly, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->raganwald<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, was inspired into his career by his mother as well.</p>

			 <p>I came across<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this articl<!-- raw HTML omitted -->e by Jacqui Cheng and thought I&rsquo;d add my two cents on each of the suggestions.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->License OS X.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  Despite the article&rsquo;s protestations that licensing doesn&rsquo;t have to be the disaster it was for them in the 90s, this suggestion misses the mark because it misunderstands what kind of company Apple&ndash;a hardware company.  Licensing OS X would only send hardware revenue to a company (or companies) other than Apple.  There&rsquo;s no compelling reason for them to give away that money.  Licensing the OS won&rsquo;t get them additional users, or revenue, or get them into some new market they might want to enter.  This is by far the worst idea on the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bring some manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  It&rsquo;s a nice idea in theory, but in reality, there&rsquo;s no compelling reason for them to do this.  Why  should they voluntarily raise their costs and reduce their profit margins?  Apple is hardly the only company doing business with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Foxconn<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Dell, H-P, Cisco, Intel and Cisco are also major customers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>8. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Invest in an independent research lab.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This has been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->said better by others<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but Apple&rsquo;s success is due in large part to its narrow focus.  People and capital used for such a lab wouldn&rsquo;t be available to help with the things that Apple is great at.  There are other ways that Apple can contribute to the public good without directing a ton of money toward basic research.  In my view, the federal government is the right entity to be doing that (but that&rsquo;s a whole other discussion).</p>
<p>7. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->More transparency on OS X and Mac plans.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like suggestion 10, the primary focus of this suggestion seems to be on Mac Pro users.  It&rsquo;s true that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac Pro hasn&rsquo;t gotten much attention from Apple<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over the past couple of years.  Perhaps the biggest reason is that it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->doesn&rsquo;t account for much of their revenue anymore<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The one point I would extrapolate from their suggestion that I would agree with is that Apple can definitely improve in how they treat developers for their platforms.  I&rsquo;ve spent my career writing desktop and web applications on and for various versions of Windows, and Microsoft seems much more &ldquo;pro-developer&rdquo; (more information about development tools, free copies of software, training events, etc).  I wouldn&rsquo;t expect Apple to try and become just like Microsoft in this regard (nor should they), but there are definitely some lessons Apple could learn.</p>
<p>6. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Make the Apple TV more than a hobby.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is the first suggestion in the list that I like.  I like the Apple TV enough that I own one for each TV in my house and have started buying them as gifts for family.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Offer streaming, subscription music.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m not sure what I think of this suggestion.  I avoided subscription music services in favor of buying music for years because I preferred the idea of owning it and being able to listen to it on whatever device I wanted.  I like the experience I&rsquo;ve had with Spotify so far, but I don&rsquo;t know if I listen to enough music to justify the monthly cost.  I&rsquo;m not sure what Apple could bring to the space that would be better.  Whether they do anything with streaming or not, what Apple really needs to do is re-think iTunes.  As Apple has offered more and more content, iTunes has become more of a sprawling mess.</li>
</ol>
<p>4. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inject some steroids into the Mac line.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I disagree with this suggestion completely.  Apple got it right with their focus on battery life and enough speed.  In mobile phones and tablets, seemingly every manufacturer using Android as the OS focused on metrics like processor speed, camera megapixels, and features like full multi-tasking.  The result: devices that had to be recharged multiple times over the course of a day.  By contrast, the iPhone is plenty fast, but I can go a full day without having to recharge it.  Multiple days can go by before I need to recharge the iPad.  Apple has correctly avoided competing on specific measures like processor speed and how many megapixels their cameras have.  They&rsquo;re competing (and winning) on the experience of using their products.</p>
<p>3. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Diversify the iOS product line.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If the rumors are correct, Apple will be offering a smaller version of the iPad soon.  The next iPhone will probably have a larger screen as well.  But beyond those changes, I don&rsquo;t think Apple should be in any hurry to diversify in the way Ars Technica suggests.  By limiting the differentiation of their iOS-based products to storage size (and cost), Apple has chosen a metric that is both meaningful and easy for the typical consumer to understand.  This makes Apple products easier to buy than the alternatives.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Make a larger commitment to OS security.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree with this suggestion as well.  Apple&rsquo;s success in the market has made them big enough for virus/malware makers to spend time targeting.</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Cater to power users again.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I see this suggestion as a variation on the them of suggestion 7.  I&rsquo;m sure Apple could do something like this in a way that wouldn&rsquo;t disrupt their current approach.  Whether or not it would net them enough additional customers and revenue to be worthwhile is another discussion.</p>

		<a href="https://genxjamerican.micro.blog/2012/08/13/introducing-autopoco.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2012-08-13 22:21:31 -0400">Aug 13, 2012</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I first learned about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AutoPoco<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Scott Hanselman.  But it wasn&rsquo;t until earlier this spring that I had an opportunity to use it.  I&rsquo;d <!-- raw HTML omitted -->started a new job<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at the end of March, and in the process of getting familiar with the code base on my first project, I came across the code they used to generate test data.  I used AutoPoco to generate a much larger set of realistic-looking test data than was previously available.</p>
<p>Last week, I gave a presentation to my local .NET user group (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->RockNUG<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) on the framework.  The slide deck I put together is available <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and there&rsquo;s some demo code <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The rest of this blog post will speak to the following question (or a rather rough paraphrase of it) that came up during a demo: is it possible to generate instances of a class with an attribute that has a wide range of values, save one?</p>
<p>The demo that prompted this question is in the AddressTest.cs class in the demo code I linked to earlier.  In that class, the second test (Generate100InstanceOfAddressWithImpose) gives 50 of the 100 addresses a zip code of 20905 and a state of Maryland.  The possible objective of the question could be to generate a set of data with every state except one.</p>
<p>After taking a closer look at the documentation, and a review of the AutoPoco source code for generating random states, I came up with an answer.  The Generate1000InstancesOfAddressWithNoneInMaryland test not only excludes Maryland from the state property, it uses abbreviations instead of the full state name.  The implementation of CustomUsStatesSource.Next adds a couple of loops (one if abbreviations are used, one if not) that keep generating random indexes if the resulting state is contained in the list of states to exclude.</p>
<p>The ability to pass parameters to custom datasources in order to control what type of test data is generated is an incredibly useful feature.  In the work I did on my project&rsquo;s test generator, I used the capability in order to create a base datasource that generated numeric strings with the length controlled by parameters.  This allow me to implement new datasources for custom ids in the application by inheriting from the base and specifying those parameters in the constructor.</p>
<p>Because AutoPoco is open source, if your project has specific needs, you can simply <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fork it<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and customize as you wish.  Another value-add of a framework like this could be realized if you write multiple applications that share data.  In such a scenario, test data becomes a corporate resource, with different sets generated and made available according to the scenarios being tested.</p>
<p>Another advantage of AutoPoco for test generation is that its use of plain old CLR objects keeps it independent of specific database technologies.  I&rsquo;m currently using AutoPoco with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RavenDB<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; it will work just as well with the database technology (or ORM) of your choosing&ndash;Entity Framework, NHibernate, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.</p>
<p>AutoPoco is available via NuGet, so it&rsquo;s very easy to add to whatever test assemblies you&rsquo;ve currently got in your solutions.  As long as you have public, no-arg constructors for the CLR objects (since AutoPoco uses reflection to work), you can generate large volumes of realistic-looking test data in virtually no time.</p>

			 <p>Apparently, renaming an assembly is a bad idea when TFS is your version control system.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, one of my co-workers renamed an assembly to consolidate some functionality in our application yesterday, and even though TFS said the changes were checked in, they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I got the latest code the morning after the change, and got nothing but build failures. We&rsquo;re using the latest version of TFS and it&rsquo;s very frustrating that something like this still doesn&rsquo;t work properly.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the solution was found at the bottom of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this thread<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The only way I&rsquo;ve found to avoid this kind of hassle is to create a new assembly, copy your code from the old assembly to the new one, change any references to the old assembly to use the new assembly, then delete the old assembly once you&rsquo;ve verified the new one is working.</p>

			 <p>I came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Jeff Atwood in my Twitter feed this morning.  It even sparked a conversation (as much of one as you can have 140 characters at a time) between me and my old co-worker Jon who agreed with Jeff Atwood in far blunter terms: &ldquo;we need to cleanse the dev pool, not expand and muddy the water&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While I understand Jon&rsquo;s sentiment, &ldquo;cleansing&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;expanding&rdquo; just isn&rsquo;t going to happen.      Computer science as an academic discipline didn&rsquo;t even exist until the 1950s, so it&rsquo;s a very long way from having the sort of regulations and licensure of a field like engineering (a term that dates back to the 14th century). Combine that with the decreasing number of computer science graduates our colleges and universities graduate each year (much less the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->elimination of a computer science department<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), and it&rsquo;s no surprise that people without formal education in computer science are getting paid to develop software.</p>
<p>While it does sound crazy that Mayor Bloomberg made learning to code his 2012 new year&rsquo;s resolution, I&rsquo;m glad someone as high-profile as the mayor of New York is talking about programming. When I was deciding what to study in college (way back in 1992), computer science as a discipline didn&rsquo;t have a very high profile.  While I knew programming was how video-games and other software was made, I had to find out about computer science from Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.</p>
<p>Jeff&rsquo;s &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t learn to code&rdquo; is counterproductive&ndash;the exact opposite of what we should be saying.  Given a choice between having more people going into investment banking and more people going into software development, I suspect a large majority of us would favor the latter.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t believe that the objective of learning to code has to be making a living as a software developer in order to be useful. The folks at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Software Carpentry<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are teaching programming to scientists to help them in their research.  People who test software should know enough about programming to at least automate the repetitive tasks. If you use a computer with any regularity at all, even a little bit of programming knowledge will enable you to extend the capabilities of the software you use.</p>
<p>We need only look at some of the laws that exist in this country to see the results of a lack of understanding of programming by our judges and legislators.  I think that lack of understanding led to software patents (and a ton of time wasted in court instead of spent innovating). The Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect IP Act are other examples of dangerous laws proposed by legislators that don&rsquo;t have even the most basic understanding of programming.</p>
<p>As someone who writes software for a living, I prefer customers who understand at least a bit about programming to those who don&rsquo;t, because that makes it easier to talk about requirements (and get them right).  They tend to understand the capabilities of off-the-shelf software a bit better and understand the tradeoffs between it and a custom system.  In my career, there have been any number of times where an understanding of programming has helped me find an existing framework or solution that met most of a customer&rsquo;s requirements, so I and my team were able to focus our work just on what was missing.</p>

			 <p>In the weeks since my last post, I&rsquo;ve been thrown into the deep end of the pool learning ASP.NET MVC 3 and a number of other associated technologies for a healthcare information management application currently scheduled to deploy this July.  Having developed web applications using webforms since 2003, I&rsquo;ve found it to be a pretty significant mental shift in a number of ways.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->No Controls<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There are none of the controls I&rsquo;ve become accustomed to using over the years.  So in addition to learning the ins-and-outs of MVC 3, I&rsquo;ve been learning some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->jQuery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->No ViewState<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s no viewstate in MVC, any information you need in more than one view should be available either in the url&rsquo;s query string, the viewmodel, or be retrievable via some mechanism in your view&rsquo;s controller.  In the application I&rsquo;m working on, we use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Agatha<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->More &ldquo;Pages&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Each CRUD operation gets its own view (and its own viewmodel, depending on the circumstance).  This actively encourages separation of concerns in a way that webforms definitely does not.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Controller is a Lot Like Code-Behind<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dino Esposito&rsquo;s book on MVC 3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and he suggests thinking of controllers this way fairly early in the book.  I&rsquo;ve found that advice helpful in a couple of ways:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->More to Come<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This barely scratches the surface of my experience with MVC so far.  None of the views I&rsquo;ve implemented has been been complex enough yet to benefit from the use of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Knockout JS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but future assignments will almost certainly change this.  We&rsquo;re also using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AutoMapper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to ease data transfer between our domain objects and DTOs.  In addition to using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StructureMap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for dependency injection, we&rsquo;re using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PostSharp<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to deal with some cross-cutting concerns.  Finally, we&rsquo;re using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RavenDB<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for persistence, so doing things the object database way instead of using SQL Server has required some fundamental changes as well.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I presented <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a brief talk on LINQPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at RockNUG a couple of weeks ago.  This post will elaborate on that presentation a bit, since the 30 minutes I had wasn&rsquo;t nearly enough to do justice to a tool I only half-joking called the Swiss Army knife of .NET development.</p>
<p>In addition to enabling developers to write and execute LINQ queries, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LINQPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can be used to execute SQL queries as well as compose and run code snippets in C#, VB.NET, and F#.  LINQ can query a wide variety of collections and data, including SQL databases and XML.  The ability to query XML with LINQ becomes quite powerful when the XML comes from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WCF Data Services<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (an implementation of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OData<!-- raw HTML omitted --> protocol).</p>
<p>During my presentation, I queried a local version of the Northwind database, as well as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OData endpoint of Netflix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->StackOverflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> publishes their data via an OData endpoint as well. Additional producers of OData services can be found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Windows Azure Marketplace<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>One of the nice features of LINQPad is the number of export options it provides for your query results.  The results of any SQL or LINQ query written in LINQPad can be exported to Excel, Word, or HTML.  The Excel and Word export capabilities give you the option of preserving the formatting LINQPad provides, or leaving it out.  Once you&rsquo;ve queried a database with LINQ, the results display allows you to toggle between the equivalent fluent LINQ, SQL and MSIL syntax.  I demonstrated this feature by executing a SQL query against the Northwind sample database, then cutting and pasting the equivalent syntax to new query windows and running them to show that the query results were the same.</p>
<p>The LINQPad website pitches the tool as a replacement for SQL Server Management Studio.  To test this proposition, I demonstrated LINQPad&rsquo;s ability to execute stored procedures.  I used the TenMostExpensiveProducts stored procedure in the Northwind database, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this script<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to show one way to use LINQPad to run stored procedures that take parameters.</p>
<p>LINQPad&rsquo;s capabilities as a code snippet runner are further supported by its ability to reference custom assemblies and namespaces.  So instead of dealing with all the overhead of Visual Studio just to write a console application, you could simply write them in LINQPad and reference any custom assemblies you needed.</p>
<p>The latest version of LINQPad also has an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extensibility model<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, if you wanted to query databases other than SQL Server (or different querying sources).</p>
<p>One feature I wished I&rsquo;d had time to delve into further was LINQPad&rsquo;s ability to query Entity Framework models defined in Visual Studio.  There&rsquo;s a brief description of that capability <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>All of the query files from my presentation are available on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Github<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>A couple of days ago, while pairing with my colleague Alexei on bug fixes to a new feature, we came across a bit of code that attempted to take an integer array and construct a string with a comma-delimited list of the numbers from it.

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
int[] numbers = new[] {1, 5, 8, 26, 35, 42};
var result = numbers.Aggregate(&quot;&quot;, (current, item) =&gt; current + item.ToString() + &ldquo;,&quot;);
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Before ReSharper served this up, I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with the Aggregate operator. When I checked out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->101 LINQ Samples<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for it, the vast majority of the examples used numbers.</p>

<p>The rapture was even a topic at work on Friday&ndash;in jest at first, but more and more serious as the conversation went on.  A few of us (two of us Christian, one a sort of agnostic) talked about the crucifixion, the resurrection, the last supper, even Christ in the garden of Gethsemane.</p>
<p>Today at church, our pastor spoke at length on the reactions he&rsquo;d heard to those who believed the world was ending today&ndash;most of them negative.  He didn&rsquo;t agree with their theology, but respected their willingness and seriousness in acting on their faith and sharing it with others. As Seventh-day Adventists (a denomination that came out of a movement that believed Christ would return in 1844), he reminded us that we should be more sympathetic to those with beliefs different than ours.</p>

			 <p>Today at work, I gave a presentation on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NuGet<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I&rsquo;ve suggested they consider it as an option to ease management of the open source dependencies of our major application, so it was natural that I present the pros and cons.</p>
<p>NuGet is a system for managing .NET packages.  It&rsquo;s not unlike RubyGems or CPAN (for Ruby and Perl respectively), and while it has some work to do to be on par with those alternatives, they&rsquo;re off to a very good start.  Today&rsquo;s presentation focused on just a few the capabilities of NuGet, and I&rsquo;ll recap a few from my presentation in this post.</p>
<p>The primary use case for NuGet is the management of open source dependencies in a .NET application.  There are a number of key open source libraries that .NET developers like me have been using in projects for years.  Upgrades were always a pain because of having to manage their dependencies manually.  Many of these tools (NHibernate, NUnit, log4net, and more) are already available as NuGet packages at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NuGet Gallery<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I used NHibernate and NUnit in my examples today.  Another tool that proved quite useful in my demo was the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NuGet Package Explorer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Some of its features include:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I wrapped up my presentation with two different examples of building NuGet packages without a manually-created .nuspec file as a starting point.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->documentation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> provides examples of how to generate a .nuspec file from an existing DLL, and how to generate a NuGet package from a .csproj or .vbproj file.  I published the rules engine (which I found in an answer to a stackoverflow.com question), and a test assembly I created to the NuGet Gallery earlier this evening.  If you want to check them out, just search for Arpc.RulesEngine in the NuGet Gallery.  I still need to publish the rules engine source as a package and/or  push it to a symbol server.  Once the enterprise story for NuGet becomes a bit clearer, I hope I have an opportunity to present on that as well.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I gave a presentation on .NET Reflector at the January 12 meeting of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RockNUG<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I took most of my time demonstrating the product and answering questions, so I had very few slides.  So instead of simply posting them here and calling it a day, this blog post will incorporate some of the Q &amp; A that happened during the presentation.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What Is It?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The title slide in my presentation called .NET Reflector an &ldquo;x-ray machine for (unobfuscated) .NET assemblies&rdquo;.  That little phrase actually understates what .NET Reflector can do.  Decompiling .NET assemblies is only one of the three major things it does (and is probably the best-publicized of its capabilities).  This tool also provides an excellent class browser and static analysis capabilities.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why Is It Helpful?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In addition to giving developers to see code for third-party assemblies when they don&rsquo;t have access to their source files, it can be quite a useful learning tool for seeing what the compiler generates on-the-fly for the source code we write ourselves.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Demos<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>One of the first features I demonstrated was the ability of .NET Reflector to decompile an assembly into multiple .NET languages.  C# is the default, but VB.NET, Delphi, Oxygene, MC++, F#, and MSIL are the other target languages available out of the box.  Using the add-in architecture of .NET Reflector, one developer added limited support for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->decompilation to PowerShell<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (download the PowerShellLanguage.zip file).</p>
<p>Around this point in the presentation, someone asked if you could cut-and-paste decompiled source into a file.  Not only does it work, but with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Denis Bauer&rsquo;s Reflector FileDissassembler plug-in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> installed, you can decompile an entire assembly into its constituent source code files (though I suspect that Red Gate Software would prefer that you pay for .NET Reflector Pro to get this capability). </p>
<p>I was also able to demonstrate the much-overlooked static analysis capabilities of .NET Reflector.  They enable developers to learn what code depends on particular methods, where they&rsquo;re used, what code exposes them, and where they&rsquo;re called.  It turns out that there&rsquo;s a free plug-in which extends this capability even further.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) plug-in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> allows developers to generate and manipulate matrices for determining the level of complexity in a software architecture.  Considering that a full-featured tool with DSM capability like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NDepend<!-- raw HTML omitted --> costs hundreds of dollars per seat license, even a fraction of those features from a free .NET Reflector plug-in are well worth the time to learn how to leverage.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->More Q &amp; A<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When I showed that .NET Reflector pulled in source code comments in its display of disassembled code, one member of the audience pointed out (correctly) that this was only possible because the XML file containing the comments was co-located with the assembly.  When I tested the disassembly capability afterwards without the XML file present, the comments didn&rsquo;t display.</p>
<p>There was also a question from the audience about how .NET Reflector compared with ILDASM (which ships with the .NET Framework).  The short answer is that ILDASM is far more limited by comparison.  It only decompiles to IL, it lacks the analysis capabilities of .NET Reflector, and most importantly it doesn&rsquo;t have a plug-in architecture to enable expansion of what it can do.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conclusion<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>My presentation on January 12 only scratched the surface of what .NET Reflector can do.  I hope this post has added more depth, and piqued your curiosity to use the tool to improve your own development experience.  You may find the following links helpful in leveraging .NET Reflector for your own development work:</p>

			 <p>Last month (for Thanksgiving), my dad, sister, a few cousins and I cooked so mom could have a break. The food turned out so well, she asked us to do it again for Christmas&ndash;including a candied sweet potato recipe I cobbled together from different ones on the internet. The recipe is below.</p>
<p>Ingredients
4-5 lbs of sweet potatoes
1 20oz can of crushed pineapple
1 1/2 cups of dark brown sugar
1 1/4 cup of I Can&rsquo;t Believe It&rsquo;s Not Butter
cinnamon, nutmeg, &amp; ginger to taste</p>
<p>Instructions
Fill an 8qt pot 2/3rds of the way with water. Bring to a boil. Boil the sweet potatoes for 15 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool for peeling and slicing later.</p>
<p>In a saucepan, melt the I Can&rsquo;t Believe It&rsquo;s Not Butter, add the brown sugar and stir. Add cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger until the sauce tastes how you want it.</p>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve peeled and sliced the sweet potatoes, lay down a layer of them, drizzle/smear on some of the sauce, and sprinkle on some of the crushed pineapple. Repeat until you&rsquo;ve filled whatever casserole dish or foil pan you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>Bake this at 425 degrees for 90 minutes.</p>

			 <p>The biggest problem with exit interviews is that they&rsquo;re too little, too late.  I had an exit interview recently (since I accepted an offer to go elsewhere), and there wasn&rsquo;t anything wrong with the questions&ndash;it was just that nothing could be done about any of the concerns I raised.</p>
<p>The second major problem with exit interviews is that they focus too narrowly. All the feedback from exit interviews comes from people who&rsquo;ve decided to leave. Assuming a company has had relatively low turnover for awhile, the feedback could be leaving out information from as much as 90% of its workforce.</p>
<p>If a company is serious about employee retention, they need to get feedback from as much of their workforce as possible on a regular basis.  In my exit interview, I got  questions about benefits, commute, holidays, and other issues. Regular, anonymous surveys on those issues would probably reveal a lot of useful information about ways benefits could be improved.  Gathering this kind of information regularly will mean that at least some (if not most) of the answers you get will be from people who still have a stake in the company&rsquo;s future.</p>

			 <p>One of the bugs I was recently asked to fix for an application required me to determine whether or not to display one of the members of a list.  This proved somewhat challenging since the lists in question were heterogeneous (two difference subtypes of an abstract base class).  It turned out that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LINQ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> provides a nice solution to this sort of problem in the form of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OfType&lt;T&gt; method<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Given an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IEnumerable<!-- raw HTML omitted --> collection with elements of multiple types, calling OfType&lt;T&gt; on the collection where T is the desired type will return a collection containing only elements of type T.  Before learning about OfType&lt;T&gt;, I&rsquo;d been using the Cast&lt;T&gt; method.  This was fine as long as all the collection elements were of the type T I wanted.  The moment this wasn&rsquo;t the case, my LINQ query threw a cast exception.  OfType&lt;T&gt; seems to work similarly to the &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->as<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; operator in C#, in that it doesn&rsquo;t complain if a list element isn&rsquo;t type T&ndash;it simply excludes it from the returned collection.</p>

			 <p>My current assignment has me working with the application build again.  MSBuild 4.0 got a number of new features which I&rsquo;m only now getting to take advantage of.  The coolest one so far is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->extensible task factory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It lets you define custom MSBuild tasks right in the project file, instead of having to create a separate DLL for them.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Andrew Arnott<!-- raw HTML omitted --> wrote a custom factory that lets you define custom MSBuild tasks using PowerShell.  Because we&rsquo;re using PowerShell for UI automation testing of our application, we&rsquo;ll soon be able to integrate those tests into our build system.</p>
<p>Another feature I just learned about is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->conditional constructs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  They provide functionality equivalent to a case statement you might see in other languages. It&rsquo;s much more flexible than the Condition attribute available on most MSBuild tasks.</p>

			 <p>One of my most recent tasks at work was determining the cause of slow performance in one part of an application and coming up with a fix (if possible).  We tracked the source of the problem down to a use of ItemsControl inside a ScrollViewer.  Because the ItemsControl instance was trying to display hundreds of complex items, it took a noticeably long time to load.  This turns out to be a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->known issue<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with a few possible solutions.  Simply changing the ItemsPanelTemplate of the ItemsControl instance to contain a VirtualizingStackPanel didn&rsquo;t fix our performance problem.</p>
<p>What did resolve our performance issue was replacing the ScrollViewer and ItemsControl combination with a ListView.  The list of what we changed includes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The changes we made reduced the load time from around 20 seconds down to less than 2 seconds for 400 items.</p>
<p>The tradeoff in moving to a ListView (with VirtualizingStackPanel) from ScrollViewer+ItemsControl is scrolling speed.  Scrolling through 400 items does go more slowly, but it&rsquo;s preferable to waiting as long as we did just to see the data.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Ars Technica reminded me of one of the things I never liked about PCs you bought from Dell, HP, or any major vendor&ndash;bloatware.  Every PC I&rsquo;ve had that I didn&rsquo;t build myself, and every Windows laptop had multiple pieces of software that I didn&rsquo;t want.  The least-offensive of these apps merely took up hard drive space.  The worst made the computer slower and more of a hassle to use.  Switching from Windows to Mac at home meant no more bloatware.  Moving to an Intel chip-based Mac extended the no-bloatware experience to Windows VMs.  Moving to the iPhone a couple of years ago (and sticking with it by buying an iPhone 4) seems to have spared me from vendor bloatware as well.  This is especially important in the mobile space because today&rsquo;s smartphones have a lot less storage space to waste, and less-powerful CPUs than modern PCs.</p>
<p>Bloatware happens on the PC because even though we buy them, we aren&rsquo;t the only customer.  Every company with some anti-virus software to sell, a search engine they want you to use, or some utility they want you to buy wants to be on your PC or laptop.  They&rsquo;re willing to pay to be on your new machine, and PC vendors aren&rsquo;t going to turn down that money.  A similar thing seems to be happening on Android phones now.  Here&rsquo;s the key quote from the story:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When it comes to Android, you and I aren&rsquo;t Google&rsquo;s customers&ndash;not really.  The real customers are mobile phone hardware vendors like Motorola and HTC.  They need to care how open and customizable Android is because they expect it to help them sell more phones.  Making the OS free for the vendors is in Google&rsquo;s interest because the bulk of their revenue comes from advertising.  The more phones there are running Android, the more places their ads will appear.  Android&rsquo;s openness is only of interest to us as users to the extent it allows us to do what we want with our mobile phone.</p>
<p>Unlike Google, Apple is in business to sell us electronics.  They expect iOS4 to help them sell more iPhones and iPads.  But since you and I are the customers Apple is chasing, no pre-loading of apps from third parties.  It doesn&rsquo;t mean they won&rsquo;t feature apps that highlight the phone&rsquo;s capabilities (Apple does plenty of that).  Nor does it mean we can&rsquo;t get apps from AT&amp;T, just that putting them on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> taking them off is our choice.  There is a tradeoff as far as how long iPhone users wait for features when compared with Android phone users.  But I think the iPhone features all work better, and work together to create arguably the best smartphone available.</p>

			 <p>I spent the past 7 days vacationing in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Curacao<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with my girlfriend Ebony and another couple we&rsquo;re friends with.  In this post, I&rsquo;ll talk about how it went, and how I might have done things differently if I were visiting again.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why Curacao?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Ebony has wanted to go there for awhile, because of the beautiful water, sun, and beaches.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What to wear<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Definitely wear light clothing.  Average high temperatures in Curacao are mid-to-upper 80s Fahrenheit year-round.  Don&rsquo;t skimp on sunscreen, or you&rsquo;ll regret it&ndash;even if your skin is already relatively dark.  My friends aren&rsquo;t that much lighter than me, and all of them got burnt.  Don&rsquo;t go easy on bug spray either.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Accommodations<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We spent two nights at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Renaissance Curacao Resort &amp; Casino<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Willemstad.  If you&rsquo;re familiar with and/or a fan of Marriott properties, this one has everything you expect.  They also have plenty of outlets for appliances and electronics from the U.S., so you won&rsquo;t need to use converters.  The only wi-fi access appeared to be in the lobby, and I never managed to connect with my iPhone.  There&rsquo;s wired internet access from the rooms, so netbook and laptop users will have an alternative to the business center.  The private beach they talk about on their web page is man-made, and doesn&rsquo;t connect directly to the ocean, but a large saltwater pool.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the time at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hyatt Regency Curacao Golf Resort, Spa, and Marina<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Parts of the property are still under construction, so we got the benefit of a grand opening rate, 4 nights for the price of 3, and free breakfast for the duration of our stay.  The service we received from every member of the staff was excellent.  Without exception, they were all incredibly courteous and polite, and went out of their way to accommodate our requests.  I thought the rooms were nice, but some of the balconies are much better for privacy than others.  The tub has a rather high edge, so it&rsquo;s a bit of a challenge to get into unless you&rsquo;re tall.  Strangely, the shower only has frosted glass on half the length of the tub&ndash;and no sliding door.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Food<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bistro Le Clochard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was expensive, but the food was excellent.  It&rsquo;s inside Rif Fort, a very short walk from the Renaissance.  We discovered that their kitchen accommodates vegetarians quite well.  It seems to be a quite popular place, so make reservations ahead of time, or you&rsquo;ll have to eat elsewhere.  The restaurant within the Renaissance is ok.</p>
<p>The Hyatt has three restaurants: Medi, Shor, and Swim.  The food at all of them is quite good, though the serving times vary widely (Shor is the slowest, Swim is the fastest).  Swim will serve you poolside or at the beach.  Their plantain chips and fish tacos were especially good.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How to pay<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>U.S. currency was accepted everywhere we tried to use it, as were our credit cards.  I checked the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tourist board website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get information ahead of time.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Activities, Attractions, &amp; Shopping<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Of the attractions available in Curacao, we got to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kura Hulanda Museum<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rif Fort<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Willemstad.  At Kura Hulanda, the extra money for a tour guide was well worth it.  It provides a great history lesson of many cultures, as well as the slave trade.  With more time, I would have visited the Mikve Israel-Emanuel Synagogue and the Maritime Museum as well.</p>
<p>During our time at the Hyatt, we went on a 3-hour cruise with some time for snorkeling.  I still regret my lack of underwater camera gear for this, because there were a lot of strange and beautiful fish to see.  There was even a small shipwreck close to where we snorkeled that we were able to see.  Ocean Encounters handled our tour, and they did an excellent job.  If we&rsquo;d planned further in advance, we could have gone on the 7-hour cruise to and from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Klein Curacao<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  This trip made me wish I knew how to scuba dive.  A trip back for the sole purpose of getting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PADI<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-certified would probably be worth it.</p>
<p>At least in Willemstad, there are tons of places to buy jewelry, electronics, clothes, and souvenirs.  Prices in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->downtown<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were pretty good from what I saw.  The street vendors just outside the Rif Fort offered the best prices, and we ended up getting a couple of very nice things in both places.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting there (and back)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We flew American Airlines from Reagan National Airport to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hato International<!-- raw HTML omitted --> via Miami.  Our friends flew to Miami from Philadelphia, then to Hato International.  During the time I researched flight costs, they ranged from $450/person to well over $600/person.  We ended up using frequent flier miles for the DCA-MIA leg of the trip to cut down our out-of-pocket costs.  If I had it to do over again, I&rsquo;d have planned much further in advance.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed (to my annoyance) about flying into and out of Miami is that the gate personnel decided to pick on either Ebony or both of us about the size of our carry-on luggage.  To make sure you avoid that kind of harassment, make sure your packed carry-on fits in the stupid little cages they have near the gates.  Otherwise, you could end up having to check a bag you weren&rsquo;t expecting and risk the airline losing it (like American Airlines nearly did with her bag).</p>
<p>The last thing I&rsquo;ll say about flying to and from Curacao (at least in this post), is to avoid taking the last flight out of Curacao on whatever day you depart.  If there&rsquo;s a problem with that flight (as there was in our case), you&rsquo;ll be stuck at least one extra day.</p>

			 <p>If you Google for information on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ItemGroup <!-- raw HTML omitted -->element of MSBuild, most of the top search results will discuss its use in dealing with files.  The ItemGroup element is far more flexible than this, as I figured out today when making changes to an MSBuild script for creating databases.</p>
<p>My goal was to simplify the targets I was using to create local groups and add users to them.  I started with an example on pages 51-52 of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inside the Microsoft Build Engine: Using MSBuild and Team Foundation Build<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where the author uses an ItemGroup to create a list of 4 servers.  Each server has custom metadata associated with it.  In his PrintInfo target, he displays the data, overrides an element with new data, and even removes an element.  Because MSBuild supports <!-- raw HTML omitted -->batching<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you can declare a task and attributes once and still execute it multiple times.  Here&rsquo;s how I leveraged this capability:</p>

			 <p>My friend Sandro read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this Slate piece<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday and wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this blog entry<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in part about enthusiasts and users.  I think his concern that today&rsquo;s computer science students seem to be more users than enthusiasts is very legitimate, since they&rsquo;re some of the people we&rsquo;re counting on for the next advances in the field of computing and innovative new products.  The similarity he sees between advances in automobiles and computing is an interesting one.  I agree with him up to a point about commoditization, but I see real benefits to certain things becoming commodities.  He touches only briefly on case mods in the PC space, but commodity hardware (RAM, hard drives, video cards, etc) has made it a lot easier for the technically-inclined to build entire PCs themselves, instead of buying whatever Dell or HP is selling this week.  Commodity hardware and operating systems are what enable a product like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TiVo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to exist (along with less-capable imitators).  We have commodity hardware to thank for the XBox 360, and commodity operating systems to thank for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XBMC<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  This doesn&rsquo;t mean that a ton of people will avail themselves of the option to build their own PC, or their own home theater PC, just that the option is definitely out there for those who want to.</p>
<p>I suspect it has always been the case that the vast majority of people would rather use something cool than build it.  As much as those of us in the U.S. love cars, very few of us will be building our own <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rally Fighter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> anytime soon.  I enjoy photography as a hobby, but I haven&rsquo;t been in a darkroom to develop my own film in years (nor did I ever spend enough time in one to get really good at the process).  At least with computers, there came a point for me where fiddling around inside the guts of a computer to get something working again got to be too much of a hassle.  This could mean I&rsquo;m gotten lazy, but I really like it when things just work.  There&rsquo;s definitely something to be said for having the ability to fix something or hack it to do something beyond its original purpose.  I&rsquo;ve always admired people like that, and I think they&rsquo;re responsible for a lot of the great advances we benefit from today.</p>
<p>I think human nature is such that we won&rsquo;t run out of enthusiasts anytime soon.  As long as there are magazines like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MAKE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and sites like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iFixit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, enthusiasts will continue to do things that make users jealous.</p>

			 <p>Planet Money, one of many podcasts I listen to in Beltway traffic, had a great <!-- raw HTML omitted -->episode<!-- raw HTML omitted --> recently attempting to explain why GDP is important.  The reporter contrasts the resources for a school in Kingston, Jamaica with a socioeconomically similar school in Barbados.  The difference in what a country can do with a per-capita GDP of approximately $15,000/year (Barbados) versus around $5600/year (Jamaica) turns out to be quite staggering.  Hearing about teachers paying for school materials out of their own pockets sounded a lot like what I&rsquo;ve heard and read in news stories and features about inner-city schools here in the U.S.  One part of the piece that I believe has broader applications to how foreign direct investment (FDI) is used worldwide is when Jamaica&rsquo;s minister of education (Andrew Holness) explained why the FDI Jamaica has received hasn&rsquo;t resulted in the expected benefits to the country.  It boiled down to not having enough sufficiently-educated people to staff the projects being built, whether it was bauxite plants or anything else.</p>
<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->paper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Peter Blair Henry (a Jamaican-born economist) goes into more detail on the comparison between Barbados and Jamaica.  There&rsquo;s also a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of him from last year on the same subject.  I can&rsquo;t vouch for these latter two links (yet), but the Planet Money episode is worth a listen if you&rsquo;re at all interested in economics.</p>

			 <p>Back on November 20, I attended a seminar at the Reagan Building on how healthcare in the U.S. could be improved through information technology.  As an alumnus of the business school, and someone who&rsquo;d worked in healthcare IT before, I wanted to learn about a part of the healthcare debate that I hadn&rsquo;t seen much coverage lately.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dr. Ritu Agarwal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gave the talk and answered questions during and after her presentation.</p>
<p>The main problem with healthcare in the U.S. could probably be summed up this way:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the past 10 years, premiums for employer-based health insurance have risen 120%.  Over the same period, inflation grew 44%, while salaries grew only 29%.  So healthcare costs are increasing far faster than inflation (and our ability to pay for it with our salaries).</p>
<p>As far as healthcare IT goes, Dr. Agarwal gave the following reasons for the slow pace of adoption by healthcare providers:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Dr. Agarwal pointed to a number of countries with successful implementations of healthcare IT.  They included Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.  Australia in particular was singled out as being 5-10 years ahead of the U.S.</p>
<p>One thing I didn&rsquo;t expect was that the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense would be held up as native models of successful healthcare IT implementations.  One key factor noted by one of the other seminar participants was that the VA and DOD systems were closed.  Providers, specialists, hospitals, etc were all part of the government.  This enables them to enforce standards, in patient records and other areas.  Another point I considered later (which didn&rsquo;t come up in the Q &amp; A) was that the government model is non-profit as well.</p>
<p>Dr. Agarwal&rsquo;s proposed solution to improving the current state of IT use in healthcare (as I recall it) was an regional exchange model.  Healthcare providers in a particular region of the U.S. would choose a standard for electronic health records (EHR) and other protocols.  Connections between these regional exchanges would ultimately form a national health information exchange.  Building on existing protocols and technologies (instead of attempting to build a national exchange from scratch) would be the most practical choice.</p>

			 <p>In this case, DC = Falls Church, VA.  I went to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->State Theatre<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to attend this conference.  Considering the cost ($99/person), the conference turned out to be a great value.  I wrote up a conference report to share with my bosses and co-workers and it&rsquo;s included below.  It has footnotes because I typed it up in Word 2007 and pasted it in here with very little editing (because after all this writing, I&rsquo;m feeling a bit lazy).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Summary<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The main reasons the creators of stackoverflow.com came up with this conference include the following:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The conference succeeded in its main objectives.  At $99 per person, this conference was a bargain.  Given the diversity of topics and caliber of speakers, the price could have been higher and the venue would still have sold out.  Of the seven official topics presented (there was an eighth on Agile after the conference ended), only the ASP.NET MVC talk used technology that I had hands-on production experience with.  I was disappointed not to see a presentation on Android, but that was the only thing obviously missing from the day.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Keynote: Joel Spolsky<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
If I were to boil down Joel Spolsky’s keynote to a single phrase, it would be this:</p>
<p>“Death to the dialog box!”</p>
<p>Spolsky’s talk argued persuasively that software often forces users to make decisions about things they don’t care about, or don’t know enough about to answer correctly.  Among his examples were modal dialog boxes for products like QuickBooks and Internet Explorer, and the Windows Vista Start button.  He talked about the other extreme (overly simple applications) as well, using the “build less” design philosophy of the 37signals team as an example.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[4]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Equating those kinds of applications with Notepad was a reach (and clearly played for laughs), but described the limitations of the alternative to complex applications pretty well.  The examples did a good job of setting up the choice between simplicity and power.</p>
<p>He cited an experiment in the selection of jam from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[5]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to show the potential drawbacks of too many choices.  When the results of this experiment showed that a display with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fewer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> choices resulted in an order of magnitude <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sales of jam, it put a monetary value on the design decision to limit choices.</p>
<p>Predictably, his examples of the right kind of design were products from Apple.  It takes a lot more effort to put a Nokia E71 in vibrate mode than it does an iPhone.  Spolsky pointed to the iPod’s lack of buttons for Stop and Power as examples of addition by subtraction.  The best example he chose was actually Amazon’s 1-Click shipping.  In addition to offering the most reasoned defense I’ve heard yet of Amazon winning that patent, he explained how it works for multiple purchases.</p>
<p>A few other takeaways from the Spolsky’s keynote that I’ve tried to capture as close to verbatim as possible are:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the most useful parts of the talk was about the approval process.  He gave his own experience of getting applications through the submission process, including one that was rejected and the reasons why.  According to him, 2 weeks is average time it takes Apple to accept or reject an application.  It’s even possible for upgrades of a previously-accepted app to be rejected.</p>
<p>Pilone did a good job of making it clear that quality is what sells applications.  He used the Convert<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[6]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> application (from taptaptap) as an example.  It’s just one of over 80 unit converter applications in the App Store, but it’s beating the competition handily.  OmniFocus was his second example.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Revenue Models<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>His recommendation for selling apps in the App Store is to release a paid version first, then an ad-supported version.  This advice seemed counterintuitive to me, but I suspect he suggested it because there’s no data on the in-app upgrades revenue model.  I see in-app upgrades as Apple’s most explicit support for the “freemium”<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[9]<!-- raw HTML omitted --> business model yet.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ASP.NET MVC: Scott Allen<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This talk was basically a demo of a preview version of ASP.NET MVC 2.  Allen wrote code for his demonstration on-the-fly (with the sort of mistakes that can happen using this approach), so the example was pretty basic.  The takeaways I thought were useful for getting started with the technology were:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FogBugz and Kiln<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Even though this was strictly a product pitch, I’ve included it in the report because of how they implement a couple of ideas: plug-in architecture and tagging.</p>
<p>Plug-in architectures as an idea aren’t new—what was different was the motivation Joel Spolsky described for it.  One of his intentions was to make it easier for people to extend the functionality of FogBugz in ways he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->didn’t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> want.  He isn’t a fan of custom fields, so instead of building them into the core product, they’re implemented as a plug-in.  He demonstrated Balsamiq integration (via plug-in) as well, so the architecture does enable extension in ways he likes as well.</p>
<p>Tagging isn’t a new idea either—what I found very interesting is how they apply them in FogBugz.  Spolsky pitched them as a substitute for custom workflow.  His idea (as I understood it) was that bugs could be tagged with any items or statuses outside the standard workflow.  There wasn’t much more detail than this, but I think the idea definitely is worth exploring further.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Python: Bruce Eckel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
His talk was supposed to be about Python, but Bruce Eckel covered a lot more than that.  The most important takeaways of his talk were these:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s Eckel’s hierarchy of programming languages:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another one of his pronouncements that stood out was a hope that Java would become the COBOL of the 21<!-- raw HTML omitted -->st<!-- raw HTML omitted --> century.</p>
<p>Eckel’s argument regarding the difficulty of writing good multithreaded code is one I’ve heard before.  He pointed to Python as a language with libraries for handling both the single processor task-switching and multi-processor parallel execution models of concurrency.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google App Engine: Jonathan Blocksom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Jonathan Blocksom gave a great overview of Google App Engine.  He’s a member of Google’s Public Sector Project Team (not the App Engine team), and I think that helped him present the information from more of an audience perspective.  He did a nice job of describing the architecture and the advantages of using it.  Some of the applications running on Google App Engine include:</p>

			 <p>One of the things on my plate at work is a macro for adding a file header and footer to all the source files in a Visual Studio solution.  The macro I put together from my own implementation, various web sources, and a colleague at work accomplished the goal at one time&ndash;but inconsistently.  So I&rsquo;d been exploring other avenues for getting this done when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott Garland<!-- raw HTML omitted --> told me about the File Header Text feature of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ReSharper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  You simply put in the text you want to appear at the top of your source file, add a new Code Cleanup profile, check the Use File Header Text option, then run the new profile on your solution.</p>
<p>The result: if the filename ends in &ldquo;.cs&rdquo;, ReSharper will add the value in File Header Text as a comment to the top of the file.  It&rsquo;s even clever enough not to add duplicate text if a file already contains it in its header.  So if you need to add copyright notices or any other text to the top of your source code files, and you use ReSharper, you&rsquo;ve already got what you need.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In my previous random SQL tricks post, I discussed how to generate random alphanumeric strings of any length.  A slight variation on that idea that also proved useful in generating test data is the following stored procedure (which generates a varchar consisting entirely of numbers):</p>
<p>CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[SpGenerateRandomNumberString]
@randomString varchar(15) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
SET NOCOUNT ON
DECLARE @counter tinyint
DECLARE @nextChar char(1)
SET @counter = 1
SET @randomString = ''</p>
<p>WHILE @counter &lt;= 15
BEGIN
SELECT @nextChar = CHAR(48 + CONVERT(INT, (57-48+1)*RAND()))</p>
<p>SELECT @randomString = @randomString + @nextChar
SET @counter = @counter + 1
END
END
GO</p>
<p>The range in the select for @nextChar maps to ASCII values for the digits 0-9.  Unlike the stored procedure from my first post, there&rsquo;s no if statement to determine whether or not the random value retrieved is allowed because the ASCII range for digits is contiguous.  The needs of my application restricted the length of this numeric string to 15 characters.  For more general use, the first refactoring would probably add string length as a second parameter, so the numeric string could be a variable length.</p>

			 <p>One of my most recent tasks at work has been generating test data for integration tests of a new application.  We don&rsquo;t have the version of Visual Studio which does it for you, and rather than write an app that did it, I spent the past week hunting for examples that just used Transact-SQL.  The initial post that I found the most useful is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this one<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in which the author provides five different ways of generating random numbers.  I use his third method quite often, as you&rsquo;ll see in this post (and any others I write on this topic).</p>
<p>One of our needs for random test data was alphanumeric strings of varying lengths.  Because the content of the text mattered less than the need for text, it didn&rsquo;t have to resemble actual names (or anything recognizable).  The first example I found of a T-SQL stored procedure for generating a random string was in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this blog post <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by XSQL Software.  The script does generate random strings, but they include non-alphanumeric characters.  To get the sort of random strings I wanted, I took the random number generation method from the first post and the stored procedure mentioned earlier and adapted them to this:</p>
<p>CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[SpGenerateRandomString]
@sLength tinyint = 10,
@randomString varchar(50) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
SET NOCOUNT ON
DECLARE @counter tinyint
DECLARE @nextChar char(1)
SET @counter = 1
SET @randomString = ''</p>
<p>WHILE @counter &lt;= @sLength
BEGIN
SELECT @nextChar = CHAR(48 + CONVERT(INT, (122-48+1)*RAND()))</p>
<p>IF ASCII(@nextChar) not in (58,59,60,61,62,63,64,91,92,93,94,95,96)
BEGIN
SELECT @randomString = @randomString + @nextChar
SET @counter = @counter + 1
END
END
END</p>
<p>The range in the select for @nextChar is the set of ASCII table values that map to digits, upper-case letters, and lower-case letters (among other things).  The &ldquo;if&rdquo; branch values in the set are those ASCII table values that map to punctuation, brackets, and other non-alphanumeric characters.  Only alphanumeric characters are added to @randomString as a result.  Having a stored procedure like this one available makes it much easier to generate test data, especially since it can be called from other stored procedures.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Thanks to a comment from Daniel Richardson on my previous MSTest post (and a lot more research, testing, &amp; debugging), I&rsquo;ve found a more flexible way of calling MSTest from MSBuild.  The main drawback of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->solution I blogged about earlier<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was that new test assemblies added to the solution would not be run in MSBuild unless the Exec call to MSTest.exe was updated to include them.  But thanks to a combination of MSBuild transforms and batching, this is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>First, I needed to create a list of test assemblies.   The solution is structured in a way that makes this relatively simple.  All of our test assemblies live in a &ldquo;Tests&rdquo; folder, so there&rsquo;s a root to start from.  The assemblies all have the suffix &ldquo;.Test.dll&rdquo; too.  The following CreateItem task does the rest:</p>
<p>&lt;CreateItem Include=&quot;$(TestDir)**bin$(Configuration)*.Test.dll&quot; AdditionalMetadata=&ldquo;TestContainerPrefix=/testcontainer:&quot;&gt;
&lt;Output TaskParameter=&ldquo;Include&rdquo; ItemName=&ldquo;TestAssemblies&rdquo; /&gt;
&lt;/CreateItem&gt;</p>
<p>The task above creates a TestAssemblies element, which contains a semicolon-delimited list of paths to every test assembly for the application.  Since the MSTest command line needs a space between each test assembly passed to it, the TestAssemblies element can&rsquo;t be used as-is.  Each assembly also requires a &ldquo;/testcontainer:&rdquo; prefix.  Both of these issues are addressed by the combined use of transforms, batching, and well-known metadata as shown below:</p>
<p>&lt;Exec Command=&quot;&quot;$(VS90COMNTOOLS)..IDEmstest.exe&rdquo; @(TestAssemblies-&gt;'%(TestContainerPrefix)%(FullPath)',' &lsquo;) /runconfig:localtestrun.testrunconfig&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>Note the use of %(TestContainerPrefix) above.  I defined that metadata element in the CreateItem task.  Because it&rsquo;s part of each item in TestAssemblies, I can refer to it in the transform.  The %(FullPath) is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->well-known item metadata<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  For each assembly in TestAssemblies, it returns the full path to the file.  As for the semi-colon delimiter that appears by default, the last parameter of the transform (the single-quoted space) replaces it.</p>
<p>The end result is a MSTest call that works no matter how many test assemblies are added, with no further editing of the build script.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of the links that I looked at that helped me find this solution:</p>

			 <p>When one of my colleagues left for a new opportunity, I inherited the continuous build setup he built for our project.  This has meant spending the past few weeks scrambling to get up to speed on CruiseControl.NET, MSTest and Subversion (among other things).  Because we don&rsquo;t use TFS, creating a build server required us to install Visual Studio 2008 in order to run unit tests as part of the build, along with a number of other third-party tasks to make MSBuild work more like NAnt.  So the first time a build failed because of tests that had passed locally, I wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to figuring out precisely which of these pieces triggered the problem.</p>
<p>After reimplementing unit tests a couple of different ways and still getting the same results (tests passing locally and failing on the build server), we eventually discovered that the problem was a bug in Visual Studio 2008 SP1.  Once we installed the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hotfix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, our unit tests passed on the build server without us having to change them.  This hasn&rsquo;t been the last issue we&rsquo;ve had with our &ldquo;TFS-lite&rdquo; build server.</p>
<p>Build timeouts have proven to be the latest hassle.  Instead of the tests passing locally and failing on the build server, they actually passed in both places.  But for whatever reason, the test task didn&rsquo;t really complete and build timed out.  Increasing the build timeout didn&rsquo;t address the issue either.  Yesterday, thanks to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Microsoft Build Sidekick<!-- raw HTML omitted --> editor, we narrowed the problem down to the MSTest task in our build file.  The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->task<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the creation of Nati Dobkin, and it made writing the test build target easier (at least until we couldn&rsquo;t get it to work consistently).  So far, I haven&rsquo;t found (or written) an alternative task, but I did find a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that pointed the way to our current solution.</p>
<p>The solution:</p>
<p>&lt;!&ndash; MSTest won&rsquo;t work if the tests weren&rsquo;t built in the Debug configuration &ndash;&gt;
&lt;Target Name=&ldquo;Test:MSTest&rdquo; Condition=&quot; &lsquo;$(Configuration)&rsquo; == &lsquo;Debug&rsquo;&quot;&gt;
&lt;MakeDir Directories=&quot;$(TestResultsDir)&quot; /&gt;
&lt;MSBuild.ExtensionPack.FileSystem.Folder TaskAction=&ldquo;RemoveContent&rdquo; Path=&quot;$(TestResultsDir)&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Exec Command=&quot;&quot;$(VS90COMNTOOLS)..IDEmstest.exe&quot; /testcontainer:$(TestDir)&lt;test assembly directory&gt;bin$(Configuration)&lt;test assembly&gt;.dll /testcontainer:$(TestDir)&lt;test assembly directory&gt;bin$(Configuration)&lt;test assembly&gt;.dll /testcontainer:$(TestDir)&lt;test assembly directory&gt;bin$(Configuration)&lt;test assembly&gt;.dll /runconfig:localtestrun.testrunconfig&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/Target&gt;</p>
<p>TestDir and TestResultsDir are defined in a property group at the beginning of the MSBuild file.  VS90COMNTOOLS is an environment variable created during the install of Visual Studio 2008.  Configuration comes from the solution file.  Actual test assembly directories and names have been replaced  with &lt;test assembly&gt; and &lt;test assembly directory&gt;.  The only drawback to the solution so far is that we&rsquo;ll have to update our MSBuild file if we add a new test assembly.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;ve spent the past couple of weeks at work giving ourselves a crash course in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and LINQ.  I&rsquo;m working on a code example that will switch the datatemplate in a list item when the mouse hovers over it.  Unfortunately, WPF has no MouseHover event like Windows Forms does.  The usual googling didn&rsquo;t cough up a ready-made answer.  Some hacking on one example did reveal a half-answer (not ideal, but at least a start).</p>
<p>First, I set the ToolTip property of the element I used to organize my data (in this case, a StackPanel).  Next, I added a ToolTipOpening event for the StackPanel.  Here&rsquo;s the code for StackPanel_ToolTipOpening:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
private void StackPanel_ToolTipOpening(object sender, ToolTipEventArgs e)
{
e.Handled = true;
ContentPresenter presenter = (ContentPresenter)(((Border)((StackPanel)e.Source).Parent).TemplatedParent);
presenter.ContentTemplate = this.FindResource(&ldquo;Template2&rdquo;) as DataTemplate;
}
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The result: instead of a tooltip displaying when you hover over a listbox row, the standard datatemplate is replaced with an expanded one that displays more information.  This approach definitely has flaws.  Beyond being a hack, there&rsquo;s no way to set how long you can hover before the templates switch.</p>
<p>Switching from an expanded datatemplate back to a standard one involved a bit less work.  I added a MouseLeave event to the expanded template.  Here&rsquo;s the code for the event:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
private void StackPanel_MouseLeave(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
ContentPresenter presenter = (ContentPresenter)(((Border)((StackPanel)e.Source).Parent).TemplatedParent);
presenter.ContentTemplate = this.FindResource(&ldquo;ScriptLine&rdquo;) as DataTemplate;
}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So once the mouse moves out of the listbox item with the expanded template, it switches back to the standard template.  Not an ideal solution, but it works.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This link<!-- raw HTML omitted --> started me down the path to finding a solution (for reference).</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;ve bought a new PC or Windows laptop recently, it probably came &ldquo;bundled&rdquo; with a bunch of free software.  It is a near certainty that the bundled software you got is awful.  Most people I know who make their living from computers (the ones who use Windows instead of Mac OS X anyway) reformat the hard drive and install only what they need to avoid this junk.  Why this software is on your computer in the first place is another story.  This post is about where you can find free software you actually want on your computer.</p>
<p>The Google Pack (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://pack.google.com">http://pack.google.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) is a great place to start adding software you actually need.  As of this writing, the pack contains 14 applications.  This includes applications like Adobe Acrobat Reader, Firefox, Picasa, Skype, and RealPlayer.  The biggest benefit of adding these applications to your new computer via Google Pack is the updater software.  You can configure it to automatically update applications when there are new versions.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Source Windows<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is another great source for free software.  Unlike the Google Pack offerings, none of the software you&rsquo;ll find at Open Source Windows is offered by Google.  The types of software are broader in many ways as well.  They include instant messaging (IM) clients, RSS clients, video playback, sound recording, graphics/photo editing, even games.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve got a new Windows machine you need to get running, get rid of the bundled software and pay those sites a visit.  It will only cost you a little time, and the quality of the software you&rsquo;ll get in return makes it a worthwhile investment.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m at the airport to pick up a couple of friends, just back from a week in Spain. Adam asked me last week if I could pick him and his fiancée up from the airport. Somehow, we didn&rsquo;t exchange a flight number along with the airport and arrival time, so I had no easy way to see if anything changed.  Thanks to the web, this was no problem.</p>
<p>A search for Dulles Airport brought up their website. A search for today&rsquo;s arrivals from Spain revealed the flight number and scheduled arrival time (which turned out to be about 30 minutes later than Adam and I discussed last week). I put the flight number into flightstats.com, and not only did it give me both segments of the return flight, it updated the scheduled arrival time and provided a near real-time map of their flight as it approached.</p>
<p>So instead of showing up way too early, I got to Dulles just a few minutes before Adam called to let me know they&rsquo;d landed. I was able to do all that (and write this post) with my iPhone 3G.</p>

			 <p>According to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this story<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, there&rsquo;s no direct upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7.  Given all the stories of people &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo; from Vista to XP, or not upgrading at all, it seemed obvious to me that Microsoft should make upgrading as smooth as possible.  Instead, XP users will have to backup data, re-install programs, and restore data.</p>
<p>Having used the Windows 7 beta on a spare laptop for awhile, I can say it&rsquo;s a distinct improvement over Vista.  It&rsquo;s just a shame that Microsoft has decided to make the upgrade experience more difficult for XP users.</p>

			 <p>The group of us that went down (my sister and I, plus two of our friends), secured our spot on The National Mall (close to 12th St NW and Madison Drive) before 9 AM.  They replayed some of the concert from Sunday while we stood or sat in the cold and waited.  What you may not have caught on TV was the big laugh we in the crowd made the first time an announcer told everyone to take their seats.  The other bit the broadcasts may not have shared was the booing from the crowd when George W. Bush was announced.</p>
<p>Getting out of DC took us longer than getting in.  The police and National Guard personnel were not very helpful at all.  We spent a lot of time stuck in a confused crowd at L&rsquo;Enfant Plaza because they decided to change one of the entry points to exit only and didn&rsquo;t tell anyone.  We saw uniformed National Guardsmen standing on top of escalators who did and said nothing.  I still haven&rsquo;t figured out how all that law enforcement managed to not have a single bullhorn or PA system to direct crowds.  The four of us managed to find our way to the other L&rsquo;Enfant Plaza entrance by worming our way through the crowd.  We might have seen it sooner, were it not for the fleet of tour buses parked on D Street.  They were tall enough to block the other entrance from view, even when I got a chance to stand on a low wall.  The commingling of people trying to get on tour buses and those of us trying to get into the Metro station (each of us going in different directions) contributed to a lot of gridlock.  There was at least one ambulance trying to get through part of the crowd we were stuck in, and they weren&rsquo;t having much luck.</p>
<p>The Metrorail folks definitely get an A for today&rsquo;s performance.  We didn&rsquo;t wait more than a minute or two for a train the entire day.  They had enough cars that we didn&rsquo;t have to let a single train pass in order for all four of us to get on.  Law enforcement in the L&rsquo;Enfant Plaza area gets a D.  No crowd direction or control, no information or conflicting information.</p>
<p>Even with these minor hassles, I&rsquo;m glad I went down there.  I had great company with me and a good time as a result.</p>

			 <p>Here are my brief impressions of it so far:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Installation<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Requires that Vista be on the machine in order to upgrade to Windows 7 Beta.  Otherwise, you have to do a clean install.  Unfortunately, you have to attempt the illegal upgrade before you get the message that tells you this.  If Microsoft is trying to get people to let go of XP, letting them upgrade from XP directly to Windows 7 might be a good idea.  Otherwise, the install was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->IE8<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Disappointing.  It can&rsquo;t render <a href="http://www.vmware.com">www.vmware.com</a> correctly, so I couldn&rsquo;t download VMware Player from the site.  I had a copy on a flash drive fortunately, and was able to install from there.  Firefox works just fine (so far).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Virtual Machine<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It looks like there&rsquo;s some sort of permissions thing preventing me from running them.  Adding the VMWare Player created an additional user on the machine.  When I tried to open the VM I already had, I got some odd sort of permissions error.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Drivers<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Windows 7 Beta detected the biometric scanner on the Lenovo T61 I&rsquo;m using and directed me to the most current driver.  Once I &ldquo;enrolled&rdquo; my fingers, it worked just fine.  It didn&rsquo;t have any trouble at all with the SanDisk Cruzer Micro 2GB I&rsquo;m using either.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Miscellaneous<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The way Windows 7 handles active program icons in the start bar is rather clever, though it still retains the unfortunate multi-function button for logging out, switching users, shutting down, etc.</p>
<p>More impressions later as I play with the operating system more.  This version of the beta doesn&rsquo;t expire until August 1, 2009.</p>

<p>For wireless access at home, you have your choice of any provider who offers broadband access.  For most of us, that provider will be a cable company like Comcast or a phone company like Verizon.  Either type of provider will be able to offer you a modem that provides wired internet access and wireless internet access.  They may try to charge extra for setting up more than one computer, but I recommend not paying.  You&rsquo;ll be able to get a family member or friend to help you for free, or a local high school or college student for a lot less than Comcast or Verizon will charge.</p>

			 <p>My dad asked me yesterday if there were any free alternatives to Microsoft Office.  The one that came to mind right away was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenOffice.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw and Base are the OpenOffice.org answers to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio and Access.  The suite is free, open source, and available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Solaris.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ready to embrace <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cloud computing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, even more options are available to you.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Docs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> offers word processing, spreadsheets, and presentation capabilities.  It does a nice job of handling Microsoft Word and Excel files.  Another alternative to the Microsoft Office suite comes from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->zoho.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It offers the same level of compatibility with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint of Google Docs or OpenOffice.org.  Zoho.com offers a wider variety of applications than Google Docs.  They use plug-ins to integrate with MS Office, Outlook, Internet Explorer, Firefox&ndash;even Facebook and smartphones (iPhone and Windows Mobile).</p>

			 <p>Comparing two XML strings is painful.  So of course, my current project required me to come up with a way to do it in .NET.  I could only use version 2.0 of the framework, and I didn&rsquo;t want to add more dependencies to solution that already has plenty (which ruled out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XML Diff and Patch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  So far, I&rsquo;ve come up with the following bit of code:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The validationXml contains a string representation of the XML being validated against.  It also means I only have to create one instance of XmlDocument.  After creating an XPathNavigator on the XmlDocument being compared,  an XPathExpression for the subset of XmlDocument being validated, and an XPathIterator, it can be called.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;params&rdquo; keyword makes the last argument optional, so it can contain zero or more names of XML elements to ignore when deciding whether or not to call an Assert.  I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to optimize this, but I think it&rsquo;s a good start.</p>

			 <p>I spent most of this morning looking for a replacement to Application.ExecutablePath.  The reason for this was because certain unit tests that depended on this code failed when a used any test runner other than the NUnit GUI.  When using test runners like ReSharper and TestDriven.NET, Application.ExecutablePath returned the executable of the test runner, instead of the DLL being tested.</p>
<p>Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().CodeBase returned a file URI with the DLL I wanted, but subsequent code which used the value threw an exception because it didn&rsquo;t accept file URIs.  This made it necessary to convert the file URI into a regular path.  I haven&rsquo;t found a .NET Framework method that does this yet, but the following code seems to do the trick:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday, I came across a spirited defense of reinventing the wheel in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a recent post from Jeff Atwood<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Dare Obasanjo <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stands firmly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the &ldquo;roll your own as last resort&rdquo; camp.  In this particular case, Atwood asserts the following:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My own experience with reinventing the wheel (in software development terms) has rarely, if ever, been positive.  Therefore, I have a lot of sympathy for Obasanjo&rsquo;s perspective.  Because I&rsquo;ve inherited a lot of software from predecessors at various employers, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of less-than-ideal (to put it kindly) custom implementations of validation, encryption, search and logging functionality.</p>
<p>There are probably plenty of reasons that development teams reinvent the wheel in these areas, but one highly likely (and unfortunate) reason seems to be insufficient awareness about the wide variety of high-quality open source solutions available for a variety of problems.  I don&rsquo;t know whether this is actually more true in internal IT shops than other environments or not, but it seems that way.  Encryption and logging in particular are two areas where it seems like custom code would be a bad idea for virtually everyone (except those actually in the encryption and logging library businesses).  With libraries like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->log4j<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->log4net<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Enterprise Library<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bouncy Castle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> available, developers can spend their time focusing on what&rsquo;s really important to their application.  Code for authentication and authorization seems like one of those areas as well.  It seems like there are a lot of solutions to this problem (like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenID<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the public web, and Active Directory in the enterprise) that time spent hand-rolling login/password anything is time not spent working in areas where more innovation is possible (and needed).</p>
<p>When I asked <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the question<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of &ldquo;what should always be third-party&rdquo; to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stack Overflow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I got some interesting answers.  Most answers seemed to agree that encryption should be third-party, except in rare cases, but there was surprising little consensus beyond that.  Beyond the scarce resources argument against custom logging (or other areas with widely available open source alternatives), there&rsquo;s a diminishing returns argument as well.  I&rsquo;ve only used Log4Net and the logging in the Enterprise Library, but they&rsquo;re really good frameworks.  Even if I had the resources to implement custom logging well, the odds that the result would be a significant improvement over the existing third-party options are slim to none.  I&rsquo;d like to see the quality argument made more often in buy vs. build decisions.</p>

We got there before sunset (when it is supposed to be the most beautiful) to avoid going back downhill in the dark.</p>
<p>We stayed at yet another great bed &amp; breakfast there, the Castle Valley Inn. In addition to a main house, it has a number of cabins, all set in an apple orchard.  It also has a big hot tub, which proved perfect for stargazing. We met a French couple there who are currently living in northern Virginia.</p>
<p>The next morning, we got to sample the apples in fresh apple juice and as spiced apples on our pancakes.  We also had a nice conversation with one of our innkeepers. They turned out to be very experienced travelers, with multiple trips to South America, Europe, and Africa under their belts.</p>

			 <p>After breakfast at the Spotted Dog Cafe, we bid farewell to Springdale, Utah (and an excellent hotel, the Desert Pearl Inn) and headed to Bryce Canyon. The biggest difference between our two canyon experiences so far was elevation.  At the highest point we could drive today, we were over 8900 feet up.  We spent three or four hours there, driving to different overlooks and stopping to take photos.  After the tough hike yesterday, my travel companions and I opted for a much shorter one.</p>
<p>From Bryce, we drove to Torrey, Utah.  It was a beautiful and terrifying drive.  Beautiful because of the sandstone cliffs and trees. Terrifying because of the substantial number of hairpin turns, the rocks, trees (or really long fall) awaiting any misjudgment, and my pedal-to-the-metal friend that I was attempting to keep in sight.</p>
<p>After surviving that drive, and checking in at Skyridge Inn Bed &amp; Breakfast, we had dinner at the Diablo Cafe.  It&rsquo;s the only time I&rsquo;ve ever seen &ldquo;free range rattler&rdquo; on a menu (and no, I didn&rsquo;t eat any).  What we did order was very good.  The dessert was excellent.</p>
<p>Even better than good food and great dessert, was having a hot tub outside my room to relax in and look at the stars before bed.</p>

			 <p>We spent most of the day inside Zion National Park (in Springdale, Utah). The centerpiece of it is a large canyon made mostly of sandstone. Even though we&rsquo;re in the middle of the desert, there is a surprising amount  of greenery (pine trees, cacti, etc).  It turns out that the desert can be quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Hiking to the Emerald Pools was very tough (we took the steeper of the two routes by accident). It wasn&rsquo;t just the rocks, but the fact that a lot of them were covered in this really fine sand. That made our footing rather treacherous, but we made to all the pools there were to see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot easier to see the stars at night out here&ndash;so different from home with all the lights and traffic noise. Springdale has narrow roads, and traffic is light enough now that you can hear crickets more often than cars passing by.</p>

			 <p>Vacations and holidays are my primary excuses for buying new toys.  Since I&rsquo;ve got a trip to the American southwest (at least the Utah and Arizona parts) coming up soon, I figured I&rsquo;d buy a new lens to capture the landscapes and canyons I plan to see.  Since I don&rsquo;t have any truly wide lenses, I settled on a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tokina 12-24mm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the Nikon D70s I shoot with.</p>

			 <p>One of my assignments is to write a script that will grant CRUD (create, read, update, delete) permissions to a database role.  SQL Server Management Studio does a nice job of generating scripts for adding logins, roles, and adding users to roles, but isn&rsquo;t terribly clever about granting permissions across types of database objects.  Some of the difficulty has to do with not having upgraded to SQL Server 2005 yet.  Thanks to some helpful people at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stackoverflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I found through a Google search, I was able to put together a script that handles the permission-granting part a bit better.</p>
<p>Step 1 was to develop a query that generated all the commands for granting permissions.  Here&rsquo;s the query I got from Stackoverflow that retrieved all the user tables and views:</p>
<p>SELECT * 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE OBJECTPROPERTY(OBJECT_ID(table_name),&lsquo;IsMSShipped&rsquo;) = 0</p>
<p>This query is especially useful because it filters out system tables and views that can appear if you query the sysobjects table.</p>
<p>Using a cursor to apply permissions to all the tables was something one of my colleagues first suggested.  I only found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this implementation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today, and adapted it for my purposes.  The change I made to the code in that implementation is in the select statement.  I populated the @tables variable this way:</p>
<p>SELECT &lsquo;GRANT SELECT, REFERENCES, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ' + TABLE_NAME + ' TO ' + @role
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE OBJECTPROPERTY(OBJECT_ID(table_name),&lsquo;IsMSShipped&rsquo;) = 0 </p>
<p>@role is declared earlier in my script as varchar(50).</p>
<p>I still need to grant execute permissions on the stored procedure.  I&rsquo;ll need a different select query to accomplish that.</p>

			 <p>I picked up a white 16GB iPhone 3G on July 13.  After a month of use, I can add my 2 cents to the tons of reviews already out there.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Battery Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I have to recharge the phone every two days, running with 3G and wi-fi off, except when I need them.  If I leave 3G on, I have to recharge the phone after a day.  From people I&rsquo;ve talked to about other 3G phones, this amount of battery life is typical.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->No Keyboard?  No Problem.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that I can type with 2 thumbs reasonably quickly, even without the physical clicking of keys.  I can&rsquo;t type as fast as I could on my old Nokia 6820, but it&rsquo;s still usable.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The iPhone as a Phone<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The only functionality obviously missing is support for MMS (picture mail).  It seems odd that phones AT&amp;T gives away have a feature that the iPhone lacks, but that&rsquo;s the situation.  While it isn&rsquo;t a feature I want desperately to use (I barely used it on the Razr), having to surf to a website to receive MMS messages someone sent you is inconvenient.</p>
<p>I like everything else.  The recent call and voicemail features are particularly well-done.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The iPhone as a Web Browser<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Browsing the web is where the iPhone really shines.  At this point, there&rsquo;s no other device its size that enables you to surf the web so easily.  If you aren&rsquo;t an AT&amp;T wireless subscriber, this feature alone is probably one of the best reasons to buy an iPod touch.</p>
<p>While the iPhone doesn&rsquo;t support Flash, I see this as a plus.  On my work and home machines, I use Firefox 3 with Flashblock enabled on virtually every site.  No worrying about ads, or video I don&rsquo;t want, or the battery life penalty that would likely come with Flash support.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The iPhone as an iPod<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Last week was the first time I used it much as an iPod (I was in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Toronto<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  As cool as the click wheel was on previous iPods, multi-touch crushes it.  I didn&rsquo;t think navigating through a large music/video collection could get easier, but it is.  Watching videos on a screen that size isn&rsquo;t bad at all.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->E-mail on the iPhone<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So far, I like this feature.  Occasionally, I&rsquo;ll see a &ldquo;This message has not been downloaded from the server&rdquo; note, but that only happens with my Comcast e-mail account.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Apps<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I spent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a lot <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of time playing JawBreaker when I was at Pearson International waiting for my flight home.  It&rsquo;s an addictive little game.  Beyond that one, the apps I use most are NetNewsWire, Facebook, and Pandora.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very pleased with it.  I&rsquo;ve only gone traveling with it once so far (to Toronto for Agile 2008), and even though I had a laptop with me, I barely used it.  If I had it to do all over again, I would have left the laptop at home and simply synced the iPhone with my work e-mail.  It&rsquo;s that capable and excellent a device.</p>

			 <p>Today I come into the office to work, and find that my machine blue-screened overnight. I figured it was Vista acting up (again), so I restarted. Once the machine is back up, I log in, only to discover that I have no network access.</p>
<p>This is only the latest in a continuing series of problems I&rsquo;ve had with Alienware&rsquo;s Area 51 machines. If it wasn&rsquo;t locking up for no apparent reason, the performance of virtual machines (VMware or Virtual PC) was slow.  One cause of at least some of the problems turned out to be incorrect voltage settings for the memory (though I&rsquo;m not sure how they got out of the factory with that wrong).</p>
<p>We spent about an hour uninstalling and reinstalling drivers and rebooting to see if we could solve the problem ourselves. After those efforts failed, I spent 2 hours on the phone with Alienware (1/2 of which were wasted by their tech support person walking me through things I&rsquo;d already tried).  The one really new thing we tried (installing a new BIOS) didn&rsquo;t solve the problem either. Alienware has concluded that the motherboard has gone bad and needs replacing. This is a stunningly bad result for a PC less than 2 months old.</p>
<p>Two thumbs down on Alienware and Vista. If you must run some version of Windows, you&rsquo;d be better off doing it on a Mac.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering how I posted this without a machine with Internet access, the answer is, with my iPhone.</p>

			 <p>I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first wrote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NDbUnit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> back in 2006.  Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t appear much new has happened with the project since then.  The current version (1.2) is still a great help for unit testing when you need to put a database into a known state.  If an application you&rsquo;re testing uses strongly-typed datasets as its data access layer (DAL), integrating the use of NDbUnit into your existing unit tests is even easier because it uses XSD files.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve revised my previous sample project using Visual Studio 2008.  You can download the source as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->zip file<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Make sure you have NUnit (I used version 2.4.7) and NDbUnit installed before you attempt to run the sample tests.</p>

			 <p>I spent part of my Sunday running through the woods shooting at friends and strangers.  The place: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Outdoor Adventures Paintball<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The occasion was a friend&rsquo;s 29th birthday.  Paintball has changed quite a bit since I first tried it as a sophomore in college.  There are college and professional leagues now (my alma mater apparently has quite a good team).  There are corporate sponsors.  They even have TV coverage on ESPN2 and the Versus network.</p>
<p>For novices like us, it was a great time.  We teamed up against a group of what looked like undergrads from the University of Maryland.  In three rounds of matches (3 games per match),  we won each 2 games to 1.  Usually it was by killing all of them off, but at least a couple of times we captured their flag and moved it all the way down the field.  The &ldquo;center flag&rdquo; variant of the game (one flag midfield that a team must capture and move forward through their opponents) was our least favorite.  We had a really long field for it in the second match, and our strategy didn&rsquo;t work that well at first.  The one thing I would differently the next time is buy more ammunition.  Even though you have to pull the trigger for each shot, I ran out of ammunition before our third match was over.</p>

			 <p>That&rsquo;s how much one (1) euro cost me yesterday when I was converting currency with Chevy Chase Bank for an upcoming trip.

<p>It reminded me of economics classes in business school, and what we learned about what countries do to defend their currency.  The Fed is doing the opposite of those things right now, so between that and deficits our government runs, I expect the dollar to be worth less and less in the near term.</p>

<p>refactor - improve the design of existing code incrementally</p>
<p>Code must:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Refactorings</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I found a much better definition for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->technical debt<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It makes a nice argument in favor of refactoring (though not as good as it would be with some way to quantify and measure it).</p>
<p>code smell - indication that something could be wrong with the code</p>
<p>Code Smells</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When to refactor:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>reduce scope - bring variable closer to where it&rsquo;s used</p>
<p>Be sure your unit tests don&rsquo;t re implement what the tested code is doing.</p>
<p>Eliminate double assignments (a = b = 0) for clarity.</p>
<p>Each method should have only one operation/concept.</p>
<p>If you must use code comments, they should explain the &ldquo;why&rdquo;.  The code should be clear enough to explain the &ldquo;what&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Favor virtual instance methods where possible in your code.</p>
<p>Avoid using the debugger.  Write unit tests instead.</p>
<p>Performance improvements tend to make code harder to understand.  Don&rsquo;t use refactoring to address application performance.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of complaints about the current state of computer science education lately.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> makes a reasonable attempt at summarizing the different ideas around what sort of graduates these programs should produce.  I&rsquo;ve been in industry long enough that my CS program hadn&rsquo;t switched to using Java as the initial language when I started.  I agree with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brian Hurt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris Cummer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the value of a computer science degree.</p>
<p>The right courses in a CS degree amount to a toolbox of concepts that you can use to solve whatever real-world problem you&rsquo;re facing.  The most recent example of this happened on the job.  We had an issue where some text files being downloaded for storage in a database kept causing failures in a process.  Because of how the process was implemented, there was no way to pin the cause of a failure on a particular line of the file.  The files in question are regularly more than a gigabyte in size, so manual inspection wasn&rsquo;t an option.  The minimal understanding I have of how compilers work enabled me to direct my staff to build a parser, so we could validate the input file before running the process against it.  Without a CS background, it&rsquo;s highly likely that I don&rsquo;t come up with a solution at all (or a really bad implementation of a parser).</p>
<p>If I had it to do over again, I would have spent more time in my CS program getting better depth in compilers, operating systems, and other areas.</p>
<p>Computer science isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it&rsquo;s relatively young as a field compared to disciplines like law or medicine.  There are probably things that should be changed, but I think the fundamentals are good.</p>

<p>The iPod I mentioned yesterday is the 4th (!) one I&rsquo;ve owned.  Each of the previous ones was sold to help fund the upgrade to the next one.  I love this one even more than all the previous ones because it handles video.  The video is watchable, even at that size.  The nano makes great use of the screen when it isn&rsquo;t playing video too.  The earbuds that came with this one are better than the previous ones, but I&rsquo;m still going to buy a better set.</p>

<p>The most important product announced there isn&rsquo;t MacBook Air&ndash;it&rsquo;s Time Capsule.  I think far more people will find a use for wireless drive backup than they will for a really thin laptop.  Because Time Capsule also works as a router and can share a USB device (or devices if you plug in USB hub), you could conceivably share even more hard drive space and a printer to every machine on your wireless network.  As far as I can tell, Time Capsule provides more capabilities than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mirra Personal Server<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (a comparable backup/Internet access product) at a lower price ($300 for the 500GB version) in a much smaller form factor.  After a copy of Leopard, I think a Time Capsule will be my next purchase from Apple.</p>

			 <p>This time, from a much higher-profile blogger than me&ndash;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim Bray<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The bulk of the post is actually about digital SLRs (DSLRs), more specifically, Bray&rsquo;s follow-on commentary to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Dave Sifry.   The starter kit looks decent, but the estimate of how many RAW files a 4GB Compact Flash (CF) card will hold makes me wonder if Canon&rsquo;s RAW files are bigger than Nikon&rsquo;s.  I have a D70s I&rsquo;ve been shooting with for about two years, and a 2 GB CF holds over 350 RAW files.</p>
<p>The only place where I might differ with Bray&rsquo;s additional points is the first one on camera brands.  Canon and Nikon between them own the vast majority of the film and digital camera markets.  This is important because it means you&rsquo;re far more likely to find used equipment of good quality in those brands than with Pentax, Sony, etc.  In my own case, the reason I got the D70s was that my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> found a refurbished one for $600 at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Penn Camera<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Maybe 6 months before that, the same camera cost $1200 new.  New lenses get pretty expensive once you get faster than about f/4, so good used ones also keep things affordable.</p>

			 <p>My earlier plan of a longer series of posts on the ins-and-outs of Lightroom was devoured by work, holiday stuff, etc.  In this post, I&rsquo;ll talk briefly about Navigator, collections, and the Slideshow portion of the workflow.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Navigator<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This feature, available in the Library and Develop portions of the workflow lets you look at various areas of a selected photo.  You can zoom in as far as an 11:1 ratio.  It&rsquo;s quite useful in Develop, since at least some of the edits you can make (red eye reduction, spot removal) are most successful when you get in really close.  I haven&rsquo;t used this feature a ton, but I certainly haven&rsquo;t found anything like it in iPhoto.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Collections<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Collections are the mechanism for organizing groups of photos in Lightroom.  They appear to be equivalent to iPhoto albums.  In Lightroom, photos have to be in a collection before they can be sorted.  Unlike iPhoto, Lightroom allows you to sort photos both in the filmstrip and the grid view.  The number of photos displayed per row in the grid view also adjusts automatically based on how large you make the application window (it&rsquo;s a manual adjustment in iPhoto).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slideshow<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In this amount of time using Lightroom, I only have one complaint: when you play a slideshow directly from the software, it starts reverting to earlier slides after you&rsquo;ve displayed around 50.  At least, that was my experience when I used to help a friend present photos from his trips to various Seventh-day Adventist churches.  I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;s some sort of trialware restriction, because that would be a pretty major bug otherwise.</p>
<p>Slideshows export as PDFs, with one slide per page.  There are five default templates, and the software lets you create your own.  You can change slide backdrops, text overlays, and layouts in a number of interesting ways.  If I get some time before the trial runs out, I&rsquo;ll make some sample outputs available in a subsequent post.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I should have used the Preview app in slideshow mode to present the slides, since there weren&rsquo;t transitions, music, or anything else requiring Lightroom to run it.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Import<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If Lightroom is on when you connect a camera or memory card to your Mac, a dialog pops up that lets you decide how to import the pictures.  It didn&rsquo;t interfere with iPhoto when I used it.</p>

			 <p>It would be easy enough to assume so&ndash;but surprisingly, that&rsquo;s not always the case.  So the following quote from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;An exception is the violation of a programmatic interface&rsquo;s implicit assumptions.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
He goes on to use a number of different examples where an thrown exception is not because of an error.  Before reading Richter, I certainly believed that exceptions were errors&ndash;and implemented application logging on the basis of that belief.  The exception that  showed me this didn&rsquo;t always apply was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ThreadAbortException<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  This exception gets thrown if you call Response.Redirect(url).  The redirect happens just fine, but an exception is still thrown.  The reason?  When that overload of Response.Redirect is called, execution of the page where it&rsquo;s called is stopped immediately by default.  This violates the assumption that a page will execute fully, but is not an error.  Calling Response.Redirect(url,false) prevents ThreadAbortException from being thrown, but it also means you have to write your logic slightly differently.</p>
<p>The other place I&rsquo;d differ with the original author (Billy McCafferty) is in his description of &ldquo;swallow and forget&rdquo;, which is:</p>
<p>} catch (Exception ex) {
AuditLogger.LogError(ex);
}</p>
<p>The fact that it&rsquo;s logged means there&rsquo;s somewhere to look to find out what exception was thrown.  I would define &ldquo;swallow and forget&rdquo; this way:</p>
<p>}catch(Exception ex){</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Of course, if you actually catch the generic exception, FxCop would flag that as a user violation.  I&rsquo;m sure McCafferty was using this as an example.</p>

			 <p>I came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the failure of the Virtual Case File project about a week ago.  I read things like this in the hope of learning from the mistakes of others (instead of having to make them myself).  What follows are some of the conclusions I drew from reading the article, and how they might apply to other projects.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Have the Right People in the Right Roles
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The author of the article (Harry Goldstein) calls the appointment of Larry Depew to manage the VCF project &ldquo;an auspicious start&rdquo;.  Since Depew had no IT project management experience, putting him in charge of a project so large with such high stakes struck me as a mistake.  This error was compounded by having him play the role of customer advocate as well.  In order to play of the role of project manager effectively, you can&rsquo;t be on a particular side.  Building consensus that serves the needs of all stakeholders as well as possible simply couldn&rsquo;t happen with one person playing both roles.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Balance Ambition and Resources<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The FBI wanted the VCF to be a one-stop shop for all things investigative.  But they lacked both the necessary infrastructure and the people to make this a realistic goal.  A better approach would have prioritized the most challenging of the individual existing systems to replace (or the one with the greatest potential to boost productivity of FBI agents), and focused the efforts there.  The terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001 exposed how far behind the FBI was from a technology perspective, added a ton of political pressure to hit a home run with the new system, and probably created unrealistically high expectations as well.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Enterprise Architecture is Vital<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This part of Goldstein&rsquo;s article provided an excellent definition of enterprise architecture, which I&rsquo;ve included in full below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Delivering Earlier Means Dropping Features<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When you combine ambition beyond available resources with shorter deadlines, disaster is virtual certainty.  When SAIC agreed to deliver six months earlier than initially agreed, that should have been contingent on dropping certain features.  Instead, they tried to deliver everything by having eight teams work in parallel.  This meant integration of the individual components would have to be nearly flawless&ndash;a dubious proposition at best.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Projects Fail in the Requirements Phase<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When a project fails, execution is usually blamed.  The truth is that failed projects fail much earlier than that&ndash;in requirements.  Requirements failures can take many forms, including:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In addition, it appears that there wasn&rsquo;t a requirements traceability matrix as part of the planning documents.  The VCF as delivered in December 2003 (and rejected by the FBI), did things that there weren&rsquo;t requirements for.  Building what wasn&rsquo;t specified certainly wasted money and man-hours that could have been better spent.  I also inferred from the article that comprehensive test scenarios weren&rsquo;t created until after the completed system had been delivered.  That could have (and should have) happened earlier than it did.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Buy or Borrow Before You Build<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Particularly in the face of deadline pressure, it is vital that development buy existing components (or use open source) and integrate them wherever practical instead of building everything from scratch.  While we may believe that the problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve is so unique that no software exists to address it, the truth is that viable software solutions exist to subsets of many of the problems we face.  SAIC building an &ldquo;an e-mail-like system&rdquo; when the FBI was already using GroupWise for e-mail was a failure in two respects.  From an opportunity cost perspective, the time this team spent re-inventing the wheel couldn&rsquo;t be spent working on other functionality that actually needed to be custom built.  They missed an opportunity to leverage existing functionality.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prototype for Usability Before You Build<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Teams that build successful web applications come up with usability prototypes before code gets written.  At previous employers (marchFIRST and Lockheed-Martin in particular), after &ldquo;comps&rdquo; of key pages in the site were done, usability testing would take place to make sure that using the system would be intuitive for the user.  Particularly in e-commerce, if a user can&rsquo;t understand your site, they&rsquo;ll go somewhere else to buy what they want.  I attribute much of Amazon&rsquo;s success to just how easy they make it to buy things.</p>
<p>In the case of the VCF, the system was 25% complete before the FBI decided they wanted &ldquo;bread crumbs&rdquo;.  A usability prototype would have caught this.  What really surprises me is that this functionality was left out of the design in the first place.  I can&rsquo;t think of any website, whether it&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve built or one I&rsquo;ve used, that didn&rsquo;t have bread crumbs.  That seemed like a gigantic oversight to me.</p>

So two clicks let me see how all the photos I shot at a shutter speed of 1/500th second looked.

So when I needed to change the white balance in a group of my shots, it was as simple as selecting the group, changing white balance to &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; from &ldquo;As Shot&rdquo;.  The same is true of underexposed shots.  My friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pointed out four photos that were underexposed.  I simply selected the four he pointed out, and pressed the button for +1/3 of a stop until they were bright enough for my taste.  In retrospect, a single click of the +1 stop button would have been even faster.</p>

<p>This is the step in Lightroom&rsquo;s workflow where you make more detailed changes to individual photos.  Each change you make to a photo shows up in a &ldquo;History&rdquo; widget to the left, so you can rollback individual changes with ease.  I only cropped photos here, but I could have changed any number of things about them.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Web<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>While this feature isn&rsquo;t so much about the photos themselves as it is about how you can share them, this part of the workflow is where Lightroom really shines.  Generating <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> took a few clicks, and a couple of slider moves.  On top of that, I didn&rsquo;t even have to use another application to upload it to the web&ndash;I did it directly from Lightroom.  There are quite a few different page templates to choose from.</p>
<p>The features I&rsquo;ve described so far barely scratch the surface of what Lightroom can do.  One of the things that impresses me about Lightroom is not just the amount of things it does that iPhoto can&rsquo;t (or does badly, <em>cough</em> iWeb <em>cough</em>) but how much less time it takes to handle hundreds of photos by comparison.</p>

			 <p>This week, an application I work on started logging an exception that provided no help at all in debugging the problem.  My usual practice of running the app in debug mode with production values in the config file failed to reproduce the error too.  After a couple of days of checking a bunch of different areas of code (and still not solving the problem), Bob (a consultant from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Intervention Technologies<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) gave me some code to get at all the InnerException values for a given Exception. Download the function from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>StackTrace can be pretty large.  Since we log to a database, I was worried about overrunning the column width.  I also wasn&rsquo;t keen on the idea  of looking at so large a  text block if an Exception was nesting four or five additional ones.   So  instead of implementing the code above, I changed the code to log at each level.  Doing it this way adds a log entry for each InnerException.  Because the log viewer I implemented displays the entries in reverse-chronological order, the root cause of a really gnarly exception displays at the top.  The changes I made to global.asax looked like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The result of this work revealed that the app had been complaining about not being able to reach the SMTP server to send e-mail (which it needs to send users their passwords when they register or recover lost passwords).</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;d established that the change was working properly, it was time to refactor the code to make the functionality more broadly available.  To accomplish this, I updated our Log4Net wrapper like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about debuggers today.  I found it a lot more nuanced than the Giles Bowkett post on the same topic.  The part of the post I found the most useful was when he used the issue of problems in production to advocate for two practices I&rsquo;m a big fan of: test-driven development and effective logging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m responsible for an app that wasn&rsquo;t developed using TDD and had no logging at all when I first inherited it.  When there were problems in production, we endured all manner of suffering to determine the causes and fix them.  Once we added some unit tests and implemented logging in key locations (global.asax and catch blocks primarily), the number of issues we had dropped off significantly.  And when there were issues, the log helped us diagnose and resolve problems far more quickly.</p>
<p>The other benefit of effective logging is to customer service.  Once I made the contents available to a business analyst, she could see in real-time what was happening with the application and provide help to users more quickly too.</p>
<p>Whether you add it on after the fact or design it in from the beginning, logging is a must-have for today&rsquo;s applications.</p>

			 <p>If you use strongly-typed datasets in .NET, you&rsquo;ve encountered the dreaded &ldquo;Failed to enable constraints &hellip;&rdquo; message.  I most recently encountered it this morning, while unit testing some new code.  There were far fewer <!-- raw HTML omitted -->search results<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the phrase than I expected, so I&rsquo;ll add my experience to the lot.</p>
<p>The XSD I&rsquo;m working with has one table and one stored procedure with four parameters.  A call of this stored procedure (via a method in a business logic class) returns a one-column one-row result set.  My code threw a ConstraintException each time the result set value was zero (0).  To eliminate this problem, I changed the value of AllowDBNull attribute of each column in the XSD table from False to True (if the value wasn&rsquo;t True already).  When I ran the unit tests again, they were successful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to research this further at some point, but I think part of the reason for ConstraintException being thrown in my case was the difference between the stored procedure&rsquo;s result set columns and the table definition of the associated table adapter.</p>
<p>In any case, setting AllowDBNull to True is one way to eliminate that pesky error.</p>

<p>Gnoso has that product niche basically themselves since Cenqua, the vendor of Clover.NET, got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bought by Atlassian in August<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Since Atlassian is end-of-lifing Clover.NET, the coverage tool bundled with Team Foundation Server is the only option for .NET code coverage functionality.
Given the choice between paying for functionality that used to be free and losing it altogether (as happened with NDoc), I&rsquo;d fork over the dough in at least some cases.  Whatever they intend to charge, odds are they won&rsquo;t be Microsoft prices.
It will be interesting to see how many other tools that are currently free make a similar transition.</p>

			 <p>While I haven&rsquo;t made much headway on my other four <!-- raw HTML omitted -->resolutions for 2007<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I just accomplished the fifth one&ndash;a two-week vacation.  From September 5-19, I visited <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seattle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vancouver (BC)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Portland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Two weeks was definitely the right amount of time to decompress from work and its typical concerns.</p>
<p>Of the three cities I visited, Vancouver impressed me the most.  It&rsquo;s the only city I&rsquo;ve ever visited with a public transit system that can take you from the heart of downtown to the base of a mountain (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grouse Mountain<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stanley Park<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a two-in-one attraction because it&rsquo;s home to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vancouver Aquarium<!-- raw HTML omitted --> too.  Harbour Centre (in downtown Vancouver) has a Space Needle-like observation deck stuck on top of it that gives you a 360-degree view of the city.  Vancouver was easily the most expensive of the three cities where I stayed.  Some Canadians must be doing quite well financially, because there appeared to be an abundance of late-model Porsches on the streets.</p>
<p>Seattle was the first city I&rsquo;d visited that had wi-fi on its public buses.  It also proved to be as hilly as San Francisco.  I got to enjoy plenty of great seafood there, though I didn&rsquo;t see any flying fish at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pike Place Market<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Seattle was also more of a college football town than I expected.  There were fans everywhere in Washington State Cougars and Washington Huskies gear.  There were also a lot of orange-shirted fans from Idaho (the Huskies opponent the weekend I was in Seattle).  The most interesting thing about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Space Needle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the exhibit inside where you could view time lapse photos of Seattle over a 24-hour period taken from cameras mounted on top.  The monorail was underwhelming, but I was quite entertained by the Experience Music Project and the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame.  People in Seattle have a great sense of humor.</p>
<p>The only really &ldquo;touristy&rdquo; things I did in Portland were check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vista House<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and some of the waterfalls in the Columbia River Gorge.   There&rsquo;s a lot of forest and great hiking out there.  The only thing missing was sunny weather (which Seattle and Vancouver had no shortage of).</p>
<p>One thing I wish I&rsquo;d done in at least one of the cities was some cycling.  Each one of them seemed quite bike friendly.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve spent a couple weeks in the Pacific Northwest, I can see why people are ditching California to move north.</p>

			 <p>I’ve spent a good chunk of this week trying to revise some DTS packages to account for changes in how MapQuest provides access to data they’ve geocoded for us.  Since I haven’t used it in years, I’d forgotten how much I dislike the user interface for it.  It probably didn’t help that I was trying to edit this things with a plug-in you install for SQL Server 2005.</p>
<p>Trying to have separate development and test environments to avoid the horrors of doing development and testing in a production environment is quite a trial also.  I think you can put settings in a configuration file, but it&rsquo;s probably something like an INI file.</p>
<p>It’s probably just as well that DTS was replaced by SSIS.  I did use that to do a bit of flat file validation for the same project and didn’t find it nearly as painful to use.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A very interesting take<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Universal offering DRM-free music directly instead of through iTunes.  I think the writer is on target in describing the motives of Universal in cutting Apple out as a distribution channel.</p>
<p>If memory serves, the big record companies tried to push Apple into variable pricing not long ago.  That move didn&rsquo;t seem to work, as the 99-cent single is alive and well on iTunes.</p>
<p>The idea of Apple signing artists directly is an interesting one, but I don&rsquo;t see Apple signing artists anytime soon.  Artist management is quite far afield from what they do best.  It might violate their recent deal with Apple Corps too.  That said, if Apple could make it easier and cheaper for indie bands to put their music out without violating that deal, they&rsquo;d probably make some money they aren&rsquo;t currently getting.  It might even help them sell more iPods (which is really the whole point of iTunes anyway).</p>

<p>At my current employer and the previous one, I&rsquo;ve tried to promote conferences, off-site training, and .NET user groups.  Getting the staff to attend them has been more of a challenge here than at my last job.  They&rsquo;re all excellent ways of keeping technical skills sharp as well as networking opportunities.</p>

			 <p>This question comes up rather often in my job, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam Turoff<!-- raw HTML omitted --> answers the question by including &ldquo;when&rdquo; as a variable.  In short, the sooner a project needs to succeed, the less likely it is that a rewrite will succeed.</p>
<p>Whenever I come across an application that isn&rsquo;t designed or implemented as well as it should be, I&rsquo;m biased in favor of rewriting the application.  That approach tends to meet resistance because the &ldquo;when&rdquo; is usually very short.  Refactoring is a good fallback option, but only if the application is relatively current.  My desire to refactor single-tier classic ASP is nil.</p>

A quick finger swipe moved whatever you needed in the right direction.</p>
<p>Typing with the iPhone turned out to work better with your index finger than with your thumbs.  Whatever logic they&rsquo;ve got in there for guessing what you meant when you mistype something works extremely well though.</p>

			 <p>Eric Sink&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->post on requirements<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the best and most concise treatment of the subject I&rsquo;ve read yet.  The document vs. database treatment of requirements and his comparison of traceability to a compiler are inspired.  He even touches briefly on the shortcomings of bug-tracking systems as requirements management systems.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the book he recommends in his post (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Software Requirements<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, by Karl Wiegers), but I have no doubt that it&rsquo;s good.  The book on requirements that I can vouch for is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Exploring Requirements: Quality Before Design<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It has tons of great advice on the process of gathering requirements.
If you analyze, design, build, and/or test software, read Eric Sink&rsquo;s post.  If you manage technology projects, you should definitely read it.  Highly, highly recommended.</p>

			 <p>They&rsquo;re ok if all you want to do is display data in a GridView control (and sort it, page it, etc).  They become a pain in the neck the moment you actually want to modify data.  The only I could get modifications to work is was by naming the parameters of your class methods exactly the same as the table column names (I&rsquo;m using strongly-typed datasets in this application).  I suppose it&rsquo;s not so bad if you&rsquo;ve named the table columns sensibly.  But the database I&rsquo;ve inherited doesn&rsquo;t have this property.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is the error messages you get when you haven&rsquo;t configured something correctly.  You get an entirely unhelpful message like &ldquo;ObjectDataSource  could not find a non-generic method  that has parameters&rdquo;.  The number of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->search results<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for that phrase should have clued me in that this control was sketchy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the drawbacks of these new controls from Microsoft.  They&rsquo;re supposed to be better than code you&rsquo;d write yourself&ndash;but God help you if they don&rsquo;t work and you have to figure out what&rsquo;s wrong.  It&rsquo;s not like you can debug them.</p>

			 <p>I came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today and wasn&rsquo;t sure what to make of it.  In my current job and my previous one, interviewing potential hires for programming was part of my job.  I can&rsquo;t say I ever used &ldquo;FizzBuzz&rdquo; types of questions on candidates, and I&rsquo;m not sure that would tell me the sort of things I need to know about someone.  I find myself asking a lot more design questions and process questions with perhaps one or two programming questions thrown in.  But before even getting to that stage, I have to feel good about their resume.  I think the majority of people give you enough information in their resume that you can figure out whether a phone screen is worthwhile in a relatively short period of time.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago, my employer updated the RAM on a bunch of our machines to 2GB.  The reasons was so we could do our development using virtual machines.  I haven&rsquo;t done development work this way before (probably because I never worked anywhere before that gave you enough RAM).</p>
<p>So far, it&rsquo;s only been a bit different than working with everything directly installed.  Visual Studio 2005 is a bit slower (of course).  The other minor inconvenience is that I can&rsquo;t add new users to TFS from my virtual machine.  I suspect this has more to do with it being configured incorrectly than with the virtual machine not being part of the domain.  Access to network shares is virtually unchanged, since you can map network drives and connect using a different user name.</p>

			 <p>Today&rsquo;s news brings word that Daimler may be looking to break up with Chrysler.  I find this particular merger interesting because it came up more than once in my MBA studies.  While the problems we studied had more to do with integrating two different engineering cultures and technology platforms, the financial wisdom of such a merger was always what I questioned.</p>
<p>I have a strong anti-merger bias, having been on both sides of such mergers at each of my last three employers.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve written about them in this blog before<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Thanks to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this transcript<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of a  PBS NewsHour segment, it&rsquo;s possible to look back at the time when this merger was fresh and new.</p>

			 <p>Last week revealed an interesting difference between C# and VB.NET.  C# operators like &ldquo;and&rdquo; (&amp;&amp;) and &ldquo;or&rdquo; (||) do it automatically.  The VB.NET operators &ldquo;And&rdquo; and &ldquo;Or&rdquo; don&rsquo;t do this by default.  So if you use these, all the conditions are evaluated, regardless of whether or not that&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>In the .NET 2.0 Framework, instead of making these operators work like the C# ones, VB.NET added two new keywords: AndAlso and OrElse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good that VB.NET has the facility, I just don&rsquo;t like the implementation.  It&rsquo;s another reason to prefer C# at the very least.</p>

			 <p>It seems clear enough to me which approach is the best way to develop software, but not everyone in my office seems to agree.  So I thought I&rsquo;d do a bit of research on the two approaches and summarize my findings here.  I really wanted to find some impartial statistics that compared the productivity of the two approaches.  In addition to the usual Google searches, I included information I could find from the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).</p>
<p>The first comparison of the methodologies I reviewed was on pages 23-24 of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a PDF<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I found at SEI.  The comparison mapped waterfall activities to agile activities and highlighted the key difference&ndash;the waterfall methodology lacks an opportunity to demonstrate the output of an iteration and make improvements based on feedback.</p>
<p>The first statistics I could find came from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this wiki entry<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  While they&rsquo;re specific to a single company, they make a very compelling case for the use of agile methods.  Agile methods (specifically <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SCRUM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) delivers more lines of codes, with fewer defects, in less time than waterfall methods.</p>

			 <p>I came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in one of the e-mail newsletters I subscribe to.  It&rsquo;s highly relevant to my current role because we use a lot of offshore staff for our work through companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).</p>
<p>The rise in salaries and the springing up of private schools for training people in IT is just what basic economic theory would predict.  The quality concerns are predictable as well.  Before I joined APS, I asked some consulting colleagues how they would rate the various Indian IT firms.  They had strong opinions on which firms were best.  A lot depended on where they recruited and how experienced their hires typically were.</p>
<p>One area the post didn&rsquo;t address that is quite important is turnover.  Because salaries in India are going up, that makes it challenging for firms to retain talent for any length of time.  This can certainly impact quality for companies like mine that use one or two offshore firms exclusive because we just don&rsquo;t know who they&rsquo;re backfilling with when they lose talent to other companies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly possible that India could start losing IT work to China.  But I suspect that eastern Europe and some of the former Soviet republics are just as likely to get some of that work.  Philip G. Armour&rsquo;s column in the latest issue of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Communications of the ACM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> talks about a technology firm in the midwest that&rsquo;s been quite successful with an offshore team in the Ukraine.</p>

			 <p>I came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this blog post<!-- raw HTML omitted --> today while researching a problem with one of our applications.  The most interesting thing I found about this article was the comparison between VB.NET and C#.  It&rsquo;s one of a few I&rsquo;ve seen that goes beyond the syntactic differences to deeper issues.  The examples in this article show cases where C# wouldn&rsquo;t even compile code that runs in VB.NET (and throws exceptions at runtime).  C# makes you work harder to write code that compiles and throws exceptions at runtime.  It&rsquo;s yet another argument in favor of C# I hadn&rsquo;t considered before reading this post.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve left to join <!-- raw HTML omitted -->APS Healthcare<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a manager of software development.   My last day at Lockheed Martin was September 20.</p>
<p>In nearly two years at Lockheed Martin (and Aspen Systems prior to its buyout) as a combination project manager, systems analyst, and lead developer, I learned many different lessons about myself&ndash;some painful, some not.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The necessity of diplomacy
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When I first arrived at Aspen Systems, I was blunt in discussing areas I felt needed improvement (code quality, process, etc).  Because I wasn&rsquo;t always diplomatic in the way I talked about what I saw, some people responsible for the work took offense.  It was irrelevant that I was describing standard industry best practices.  Co-workers who were offended became far more difficult to work with.  Being more diplomatic would have made life easier.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The importance of corporate culture<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>My experience at Aspen Systems led me to conclude that corporate culture is as important as profitability.  It affects the quality of work, the caliber of employees, how co-workers treat each other, how management treats staff, and employee retention.  I had a lot of disagreements with how things worked in all of these areas (which is probably why I only lasted two years in a company that had an average tenure of seven years).  Two other people who joined Aspen after I did ended up leaving before I did.  Corporate culture played a role in their departures too.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Project management is really personality management<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t manage difficult personalities very well on my projects.  To succeed at project management, it&rsquo;s vital to have that ability.  Being able to put together realistic work breakdown structures, project plans, and budgets is important&ndash;and I did all those things well&ndash;but being more able to persuade others to do certain tasks would have made my job much easier.  When the people assigned to your project(s) don&rsquo;t actually report to you, persuasion is the only tool you have.  Being more diplomatic would have helped me.  Beyond that however, the role of project manager needed far more support from the organization than it received.</p>
<p>While the skills are useful, project management is not something I&rsquo;ll take on as a full-time role in the future.  I&rsquo;m better at other things.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s been quite bit of buzz in the press about the possibility of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aston-Martin (and possible Jaguar and Land Rover) being sold<!-- raw HTML omitted --> lately.  It interests me not because an Aston-Martin has usually been what James Bond drives in the movies, but because of a negotiation assignment in business school.

As it turned out, our negotiations failed (Ford and Jaguar stayed separate).</p>
<p>The negotiations failed because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I didn&rsquo;t account for the interests of a few of the Jaguar execs who would be &ldquo;redundant&rdquo; in the new organizational structure (they wanted their golden parachutes).

It&rsquo;s been a couple of years since that class, but the recent sales talk feels a bit like vindication.</p>

			 <p>After last week&rsquo;s post about the stored procs vs. ad-hoc SQL debate, I decided I&rsquo;d take a look at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MyGeneration<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gentle.NET<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if I could think of the right project. I decided to start with a simple contact form.</p>
<p>Anytime a form has dropdowns, I try to use database tables to populate them.  So I started by copying data for the dropdowns from an existing database to a new one for the project.  Once I created a business logic assembly for the new classes to belong to, I fired up MyGeneration and ran the Gentle.NET business entity template.  Creating the classes was very easy.  the real challenge turned out to be referring to the right Gentle assemblies in my projects.  Because I&rsquo;d included references to Gentle.Common, Gentle.Framework, Gentle.Provider.SQLServer and log4net in the business logic assembly, I thought that was all I needed to do.  But the web project wouldn&rsquo;t compile.  In order to get the page working, I had to add Gentle.Common and Gentle.Framework references to web project.</p>
<p>Once I sorted out my reference issues (and added a Gentle.config file), finishing the contact form went very quickly.  I developed this bit of code for loading any dropdown list:</p>
<p>private void LoadDropDown(ref DropDownList ddl, IList dropDownItems, string textField, string valueField)
{
ddl.DataSource = dropDownItems;
ddl.DataTextField = textField;
ddl.DataValueField = valueField;
ddl.DataBind();
}</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s called:</p>
<p>if (!Page.IsPostBack)
{
this.LoadDropDown(ref ContactTypeList,BLL.ContactType.ListAll(),&ldquo;Name&rdquo;,&ldquo;ContactTypeId&rdquo;);
this.LoadDropDown(ref SubjectList,BLL.InformationType.ListAll(),&ldquo;Name&rdquo;,&ldquo;InformationTypeId&rdquo;);
this.LoadDropDown(ref OrgTypeList,BLL.Audience.ListAll(),&ldquo;Name&rdquo;,&ldquo;AudienceId&rdquo;);

			 <p>I decided to post on this topic today because of an article I saw on the printer at work this morning.  You can check out the entire article yourself <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but what made me decide to post was the author&rsquo;s assertion that VB.NET can be &ldquo;considerably less verbose than C#&rdquo; because of the &ldquo;with&rdquo; keyword.  He left out the existence of the &ldquo;using&rdquo; keyword in C#.  The code he writes as an example could be simplified to the following:</p>
<p>using (TabPage tp = tabControl1.TabPages[0]){
tp.BackColor = Color.Red;
tp.BorderStyle = BorderStyle.Fixed3D;
tp.ToolTipText = &ldquo;Click Me!&quot;;
tp.Text = &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo;;
}</p>
<p>In C#, the keyword does double-duty by indicating inheritance from .NET and COM libraries.  In VB.NET,  another keyword (Imports)  is needed for this task.</p>
<p>The author is right about the existence of more automatic formatting and IntelliSense code-completion  in VB.NET.  However, I consider it more a hindrance than a help when creating properties.  In C#, if you want to create a read-only or write-only property, you write the property with just the get block or the set block.  In VB.NET, you&rsquo;re required to provide a ReadOnly or WriteOnly keyword to get the same effect.</p>
<p>The initial reason I decided to learn C# instead of VB.NET is a demo I saw from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don Box<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at a Guerilla.NET class in 2001.  He took a MS Visual C++ sample app and used the .NET Framework to compile it.  He didn&rsquo;t have to change a single line of code to get this to work.  He said at the time that this was the only language that trick was going to work for.  He turned out to be right.</p>
<p>Early on, another argument in favor of C# was the number of code samples and books.  It seemed heavily in favor of C# versus VB.NET, though the gap has certainly narrowed in subsequent years.</p>
<p>A third argument in favor of C# is what language software products are being built in.  I heard plenty of rumors in 2001 about Microsoft rewriting some things in C#.  But what&rsquo;s certainly true is that some companies are building products with C#.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Writely<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a recent acquisition of Google, is written in C#.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Community Server<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, from Telligent, is also written in C#.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NUnit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an excellent unit testing tool (ported from JUnit), is also written in C#.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NAnt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a C# port of the Ant build tool.</p>
<p>Mine is just one opinion among many as to whether you should use C# or VB.NET.  But when there&rsquo;s a development team involved, the language to be used should be the one the majority of developers are familiar with.  That&rsquo;s why I chose VB.NET when building <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MethResources.gov<!-- raw HTML omitted --> even though I personally prefer C#.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in April, at the end of my first post on the topic of &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->open source .NET<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d written that the next post in the series would be about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Community Server<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Telligent released version 2.1 of their flagship product just last week.</p>
<p>I first found the product at the end of 2004, when it was still Community Server: Forums.  My employer was bidding on a project to provide an online forum to one of our government clients.  One option they were considering was to make a copy of a custom online forum they&rsquo;d already done for another client and modify it to suit the new requirements.  This option reminded me of two things I dislike most about custom development:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Is open source the best choice for this application?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because of how long online forums have been around, open source is a particularly good choice for this application.  I came across a pretty large number of options for online forums when I was searching.  That said, a number of them were written in languages like PHP or Perl for UNIX (which helps answer question 2).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. What platform are your developers most skilled at building for?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
As a Microsoft shop, trying to deliver a customized solution on a platform the developers weren&rsquo;t familiar with was far too high a risk.  This eliminated a significant number of the applications I&rsquo;d seen.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. Is the best open source application on the .NET platform?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In 2004, I would have said no.  To me it seemed more likely that the best open source forum application would be on UNIX, simply because of longevity.  But given what the developers we had were familiar with, and the alternative of cut-and-paste inheritance with a classic ASP solution, Community Server: Forums was the best for our purposes.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. Is it our goal to re-sell an application we&rsquo;ve extended?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Unlike our experience with IssueTracker, the objective of making money with modified versions of this application was clear from the very beginning.</p>
<p>There are two &ldquo;barriers to entry&rdquo; with Community Server that proved significant in our case:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the plus side, Community Server is quite well-built.  Its naming and architecture are consistent enough that it took me relatively little time to customize a version of it for my most recent project: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pushingback.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The site is customized in a way that would make it quite easy for us to upgrade the site from Community Server 2.0 to 2.1 if requested.  If the companies that currently use it are any indication (Microsoft, Dell, MSNBC), it&rsquo;s one of the bigger (if not the biggest) successes of open source on the .NET platform.
In my next post on this subject, I&rsquo;ll discuss an issue that seems unique to open source on .NET&ndash;competing products from Microsoft.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t blogged in awhile since finishing my latest project, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pushingback.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  My employer sent me off to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cognos 8<!-- raw HTML omitted --> training last week.  I&rsquo;ve spent the rest of the time doing what I can to fill in the void between billable projects.  My boss tries to fill in the time by assigning me tasks like documentation, and creating PowerPoint presentation on this or that flavor-of-the-month technology.  The latest such assignment is to lead a project to create a web application our clients can use to communicate with us about past, present, and future projects.</p>
<p>My employer was very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cheap<!-- raw HTML omitted --> concerned about the impact on the budget, so when it came time to implement an internal solution for defect/issue tracking back in 2004, we chose to customize the ASP.NET IssueTracker starter kit (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve discussed this earlier<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) instead of dropping some cash on FogBugz or Bugzilla.</p>
<p>Now that my boss has suggested looking at COTS or open source solutions (again), I&rsquo;ll be spending at least some of this downtime trying to find an improved solution.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today I&rsquo;ve been spending a bit of time fiddling around with Visual Studio 2005, particularly the ASP.NET 2.0 membership functionality.  When I visited 4GuysFromRolla.com to see what they had to say about it, I came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5-part series<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of articles.  The examples are in VB.NET, so I&rsquo;ve been rewriting them in C# (my preferred .NET language) as I go along.  What stood out about their information message example in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->part 4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the series was that they added a label to their login page and set the text string based on the error details.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that there should be a property in the Login control that could be set programmatically instead of adding a label that results in two error messages for the user to look at.  It didn&rsquo;t take much digging before I found it.  The property: FailureText.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how my revised code looks:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->      protected void Login1_LoginError(object sender, EventArgs e){              <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->    MembershipUser userInfo = Membership.GetUser(this.Login1.UserName);                <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->    } else {                      <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->        if (!userInfo.IsApproved){                              <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->            SetLoginFailureText(string.Format(&ldquo;The account with the username &lsquo;{0}&rsquo; has not yet been approved by the site&rsquo;s administrators.&rdquo;, this.Login1.UserName));                      <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Since Vista will probably be behind what Apple users now get with Mac OS X Tiger (not to mention Leopard when that finally comes out), perhaps Microsoft should quit kidding themselves.  A Windows XP Service Pack 3 release this year might help make up for Vista being so late.  Then they can target the Leopard feature-set so that they&rsquo;re actually releasing something competitive in 2008.</p>

<p>I always check to see if a solution to my problem already exists before building my own, so when it came time to develop the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MethResources.gov RSS feed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I simply reused the example from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott Mitchell<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Behind the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ONDCP podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (I did the database work, a colleague did the rest) is a classic ASP application with the most basic admin functionality.</p>
<p>To cut down on this sort of one-off RSS app building, I&rsquo;ve been hunting around for any bits of code or fully-formed toolkits that could be reused easily.  The latest interesting bit of code I came across is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ASP.NET 2.0 RSS Toolkit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It&rsquo;s from a Microsoft employee, and most comments I&rsquo;ve read on it have been positive.  Of course, when I tried to get the samples to work, I had all kinds of problems.  The solution was to create a new website project (with location = &ldquo;File System&rdquo;) , browse to the samples directory of the toolkit, and open the existing website.  Once I did this, and added RssToolkit.dll to the GAC, all six scenarios worked perfectly.  The two examples I tried from Scott Guthrie&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog entry<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the toolkit worked also.</p>

It&rsquo;s small and light, and manages to integrate an FM tuner.  It&rsquo;s $84, $15 more than the iPod shuffle of the same capacity (512MB).  You&rsquo;d also have to use MusicMatch Jukebox instead of iTunes.</p>
<p>Searching through PC Magazine revealed another option: the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Samsung Yepp YP-T5<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s an old review, but this player includes a screen, an FM tuner, and voice recording for under $60.  The catch: it only has 256MB of space for music.  Samsung has similarly sized (i.e. larger) offerings to the iPod shuffle that cost around $100.  None of the ones I&rsquo;ve seen offers more capacity than the 1GB shuffle, and some offer less capacity at a higher price.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep hoping he goes with an iPod instead of something else.  So far I&rsquo;m underwhelmed by the iPod&rsquo;s competition.</p>

			 <p>According to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Amazon&rsquo;s patent is being reviewed because it looks like the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office granted a similar one 18 months before Amazon&rsquo;s filing.  It will be interesting to see what fallout there would be from a decision invalidating Amazon&rsquo;s patent.</p>
<p>That aside, this brief story does a nice job of pointing out how profoundly broken the patent system is.  The prior patent wasn&rsquo;t found by a USPTO employee, but an actor from New Zealand who was angry about a slow book delivery and wanted to get back at Amazon.  If Amazon hadn&rsquo;t made one of their customers upset, who knows if this would have ever been found.  The patent review will probably revisit these <!-- raw HTML omitted -->requirements<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>

			 <p>I saw this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->insightful article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the subject in a &ldquo;most popular articles&rdquo; list.  The author, Douglas Reilly, acknowledges at the beginning of the article that he uses stored procedures virtually all the time, but still does a great job of describing the pros and cons of each approach.</p>
<p>The most useful thing the article taught me was that as of version 7, SQL Server keeps execution plans for all statements, not just stored procedures.  This reduces the advantage of stored procedures for basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations substantially.  I&rsquo;ve certainly touted the superior performance argument in comparing stored procedures to ad-hoc SQL before, so I&rsquo;m glad I learned the real deal now.
That said, I still hold a bias in favor of stored procedures.  Once upon a time, I worked for Sybase Professional Services as a DBA, and they were definitely pro-stored procedure.  Nearly every shop I&rsquo;ve worked in since then has been similarly inclined.  Anytime an employer has used ad-hoc SQL, it&rsquo;s been absolute murder to maintain.  In my experience, the maintenance advantage of stored procedures over ad-hoc SQL is substantial, not slight (as Reilly concludes).</p>
<p>One issue the article doesn&rsquo;t bring up that might be interesting is source code control for stored procedures and other database elements (views, user-defined functions, etc).  While SQL Server does have backup and restore, it&rsquo;s not nearly as granular or convenient as the check-in/check-out model of today&rsquo;s source code control systems.  On my projects, I tend to generate a script with just the stored procedures in it and store that in SourceSafe.  I&rsquo;d certainly like a better solution, but haven&rsquo;t found one yet.  I&rsquo;m curious to see what SQL Server 2005 is like, since it will allow you to write stored procedures in C# or VB.NET.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So says Walt Mossberg<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the man with the job I envy most in technology.</p>
<p>I agree with what he says for the most part on the advantages of the end-to-end model versus the component model.  One thing I would say that&rsquo;s slightly different is that Apple is winning not merely because of the tight linkages, but because of the quality of the end product, and their huge market share.</p>
<p>Having lost what Mossberg describes as &ldquo;the first war&rdquo; in the personal computing space, Apple took a look at the MP3 player market and delivered a product significantly ahead of the competition in quality and ease of use.  Even when connected to a PC (as I did with my first iPod), using MusicMatch for the music software, I liked the experience better than other players I&rsquo;d considered.  Once iTunes came to the PC, it made things even easier.</p>
<p>Part of what helped Apple get its current marketshare in the digital music market is their refusal to inflict the subscription model on their customers.  They understood that people want to own music instead of renting it and delivered just that.  Between that, their great per-track price point, and the minimum necessary DRM, there are plenty of reasons to choose Apple over the competition.</p>

			 <p>One of things I like the least about working with multiple development, QA, and production environments is messing around with configuration files to make sure the different versions point at the right databases.  Add the use of the Enterprise Library, and there are even more files to manage.</p>
<p>In my last year at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ciena<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I worked in a group where they&rsquo;d put together some code that detected what environment it was in (development, QA, or production) and retrieved the correct settings from web.config.  It was similar to the solution <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mike Gunderloy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> describes in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article on ASP.NET 2.0 productivity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>When I was poking around for more information on config file handling, I came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that references Gunderloy&rsquo;s that talks about a file attribute for the appSettings tag.  I hadn&rsquo;t come across the existence of that attribute anywhere else before.  I&rsquo;ll definitely use this on my next project.</p>

<p>I tried &ldquo;v for vendetta&rdquo; as a search in both <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A9.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to see how the results differed (if at all).  In my case, the top 6 links from A9 were to the V for Vendetta website by Warner Brothers (hits 1-2), its IMDB entry (hits 3-4), its Wikipedia entry, and its Rotten Tomatoes review.  Google gave me the same hits, in almost the same order.  The only difference was that the top result returned showtimes for the movie close to my zip code.  A9 actually provides that info too, you just have to check the &ldquo;Movies&rdquo; option.</p>
<p>It looks like Microsoft&rsquo;s search has actually improved somewhat since I last tried it.  I&rsquo;ll be curious to see what moves Google and Yahoo make to try and stay top two in market share.</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>When I talked to my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandro <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about the switch and told him what search term I used, he suggested I use a tougher search term to test the relevance of lower-level results.

<p>The latest panic compelled me to do a bit of research (i.e. Googling) to find out what constituted a valid Social Security number.

<p>The regular expression you get from Microsoft&rsquo;s web user control for SSN validation is relatively simple: d{3}-d{2}-d{4}.  One of the developers changed things to use this: ^(?!000)([0-6]d{2}|7([0-6]d|7[012]))([ -]?)(?!00)dd3(?!0000)d{4}$</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open source on the .NET platform is a topic I&rsquo;ve been thinking about for awhile.  My current boss has made it a point to try and use open source applications built with .NET whenever possible.  This is the first in an occasional series of posts on the topic.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A good definition of the term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; comes from Vaskin Kissoyan of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lokion, Inc.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Here&rsquo;s the software developer aspect of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the full definition<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Issue Tracker starter kit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the first open source .NET application our group at Aspen Systems (now <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lockheed Martin IT<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) tried to use.  The group lacked a formal, centralized way of tracking bugs in the software we developed, so my manager saw it as a no-cost way to build our skill with C# (it&rsquo;s also available in VB.NET) and .NET and improve our development process.</p>
<p>Looking back on the experience, we should have answered the following questions before we moved forward with the IssueTracker starter kit:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Even if there was no willingness to spend money (and there wasn&rsquo;t) and open-source was the direction chosen, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bugzilla<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is used by enough companies and organizations (including Id Software, NASA, and Akamai) that we should have considered it far more strongly than we did.</p>
<p>We were (and still are) primarily a Microsoft shop, so the developers were most familiar with that platform.  Unfortunately, too many of them were new enough to ASP.NET that they wrote applications the same way they would have in classic ASP.  This was probably why boss felt the application would be a good learning tool.
When it comes to open source, the odds that the best solution will be written in .NET are low.  None of the open source bug/issue tracking solutions written in .NET that I was able to find came anywhere close to Bugzilla or FogBugz in user interface, functionality, or documentation.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t going through the trouble of extending Issue Tracker because we wanted to re-sell it.  It was (and is) strictly for internal use.  From my perspective, the only reason to assign people from revenue-generating projects to extending this app was if we planned to re-sell the resulting application.</p>
<p>At the time, I believed we made the wrong choice in trying to turn Issue Tracker into a production system.  The year that has past has only strengthened that belief.  The resulting application is regularly changed and updated to accomodate requests from any number of people.  It takes development resources we really need for projects that make the company money.  It still lacks useful features that can be found in more mature products (both open source and COTS) .</p>
<p>In my next post on this subject, I&rsquo;ll examine how these four questions apply to a more robust open source .NET application: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Community Server<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>In the nearly 11 years I&rsquo;ve been writing software for real money, I haven&rsquo;t had any internationalization projects until now.  The project I&rsquo;ve been assigned most recently is an electronic forms application that will allow the spouses of police, fire, and other public safety officers injured or killed on duty to apply for benefits.  It certainly isn&rsquo;t the most cheerful app I&rsquo;ve ever helped write, but it&rsquo;s definitely one of the more important ones.</p>
<p>Dealing with resource files has been the biggest pain of the entire project.  We lack consistent naming conventions for variable names.  We also lack consistent locations for the variable names.  This results in the need to pull strings for one form from multiple resource files.  Sometimes, variable names and locations have been changed arbitrarily and without warning.  This meant that code I&rsquo;d written one day that displayed the correct text, displayed nothing the next day.  A few of those changes cost me half a day of rework (and every bit counts when your deadline won&rsquo;t move).</p>
<p>When I finally had a chance to look for information on internationalization in .NET, I came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an excellent article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DevX<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It&rsquo;s the first in a 3-part series of articles that ends with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->decent checklist of issues<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to consider in an internationalization project.  The sample application is more complex than my assignment because they&rsquo;re internationalizing database content as well as static content.</p>
<p>So far, I think we would have helped ourselves a lot if we&rsquo;d thought of the resource files as classes.  I&rsquo;m not sure what the performance implications of more resource files with fewer strings would be versus fewer resource files with more strings, but I think it would improve our speed of development.</p>

			 <p>These are the words I least want to hear, especially when it comes to my job.  I heard them today from one of my bosses because I&rsquo;ve been writing code for one of his projects.  It has the usual immovable launch date and changing requirements.  The latter is why I was added to the project.  The client decided, in all their wisdom, that an application we were building for them needed to be bilingual (displaying English or Spanish depending on the viewer).  This is after changing the platform from Java on Unix to ASP.NET &amp; C# on Windows.  All this, one month before the scheduled launch.</p>
<p>Part of me is amused by this situation because I&rsquo;ve been telling this boss for months that we don&rsquo;t have enough developers.  Because my title is &ldquo;senior systems analyst&rdquo;, writing code isn&rsquo;t supposed to be my primary job.  This same boss has said in the past that he didn&rsquo;t want me to write code.  So it&rsquo;s rather ironic (and annoying) that I&rsquo;m who he asks to write code when it looks like his project will miss its deadline.</p>
<p>Needing heroism on most of your projects means something is seriously wrong with the process.  It&rsquo;s particularly discouraging when your employer received a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CMMI<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Level 2 certification within the past six months.  That level is supposed to mean heroism is in the past.  In reality, CMMI Level 2 means a ton of documentation (and a ton of time spent writing it).  It doesn&rsquo;t fix inaccurate budgets estimates or timelines, clients that keep changing their minds about what they want or a lack of developers to actually build the product.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I should have written this back in February, since I don&rsquo;t have nearly as many recommended links as I should.  Anyway, here are a few notes on my most recent car-buying experience.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What Can I Afford<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The first thing I had to do was figure out how much I could afford to spend.  During my research, I came across a rule of thumb that said you could <!-- raw HTML omitted -->spend up to 20% of your net income on a monthly car payment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  When I found out what that figure was for me, it seemed way too high.  So I cut it down to about 12% of my net and moved on to the next step.
The other thing I did which proved quite handy later was get pre-approved for a set loan amount.  I&rsquo;m a Costco member, so I went through their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->auto financing &amp; refinancing service<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do this.  The end result of this process was a rate of 5.3% on $25,000 over 5 years.  Capital One, the company Costco partners with for this service, gives you check and a payment schedule so you can shop for a car as if you&rsquo;re paying cash.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What Do I Want<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Deciding what I wanted was the easiest part of the process (since the previous step removed the delusional &ldquo;I want a Lexus&rdquo; thoughts).  There&rsquo;s tons of information on the Web when it comes to cars and costs.  I found <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edmunds.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to be especially helpful.  I used Consumer Reports for some of my research too.  After settling on the idea of buying a car with at least four doors, my field of choices narrowed to Audi and Volkswagen.  For options, the only real must-haves were leather seats and a sunroof.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Test Drives<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I thought pretty hard about buying a certified pre-owned car instead of a new one, so I ended up test driving a number of used Audi A4s and Volkswagen Passats (both with the 1.8 liter turbo engine).  In the case of the 2005 Passat, it wasn&rsquo;t enough engine for that size car.  The A4 with quattro was a bit better.  The real challenge with the certified pre-owned cars was finding one that was the right price that didn&rsquo;t have more miles on it than I was comfortable with.</p>
<p>Moving on to new cars, I considered the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Audi A3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It&rsquo;s a nice car, but a bit small.  Add too many options and it gets expensive in a hurry.  Since my last car was a 2000 Volkswagen Jetta, I thought I&rsquo;d at least test-drive the new Passat.  I wanted a fallback if I couldn&rsquo;t get a reasonable offer on the A3.  The way the Passat handled during the test drive really impressed me.  Even with the 2 liter turbo, it&rsquo;s quite agile.  It&rsquo;s got tons of room inside as well.  Given those factors, and the substantially lower cost compared with the A4, I felt comfortable choosing it.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pricing my trade-in<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I didn&rsquo;t want the trade-in of my car to have any impact on the price I was ultimately offered for a new Passat.  So I took my Jetta to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CarMax<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to have it appraised.  They offered me $5500 for it, probably because of the high mileage (nearly 100k in less than 6 years).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pricing the new car<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I used Edmunds.com to get quotes on a Passat from multiple dealers at once.  They all offer &ldquo;special&rdquo; Internet-only pricing at points during the year.  At my friend Sandro&rsquo;s suggestion, I timed things so that the purchase would happen at the end of February.  The hope was that their need to hit sales quotas would make dealers more flexible on price.  In the case of the two dealers I seriously considered buying from (Congressional and Antwerpen), it seemed like that did factor into the outcomes.  In order to offer me a lower price, both dealers offered to sell demo cars at a lower price.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Closing the deal<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
One key advantage I had in getting the best price was Sandro&rsquo;s friend Elmer.  He works in auto finance, so he knows the secret numbers and incentives that aren&rsquo;t going to show up in a Consumer Reports price sheet or an Edmunds.com report.  I told him what my best offer from Congressional was and what option package I wanted and he found a car at a friend&rsquo;s dealership at a price that was a little lower.  Once we showed up at Antwerpen to check things out, they offered a demo model at a lower price.  The mileage was much lower than they thought, so I chose to buy there instead of trekking back to Congressional.
This is where my second advantage came in.  While I was doing some of the paperwork, Sandro remembered that I was supposed to get owner loyalty credit since I&rsquo;d bought a Volkwagen before.  His memory saved me $500.
After a driver from Antwerpen took the Jetta for a test-drive, they matched the CarMax appraisal for trade-in value.  In retrospect, my mistake was telling them how much CarMax had offered.  I&rsquo;d kept the car in good enough condition that their driver commented on it.  Telling them the appraisal value probably cost me $500-$600.
When it came time to deal with financing, this is where my Costco exercise paid off.  Volkswagen Credit initially offered a 5.9% interest rate on the car, quite a bit higher than what Capital One had offered.  So I mentioned that I&rsquo;d gotten pre-approved for a better rate and their 5.9% turned into 5.3% in a matter of seconds :-)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The end result<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I paid $25,500 for a car with an MSRP of $28,430.  They also threw in a 2GB iPod nano as part of the promotion they were running that month.</p>

			 <p>Last month, I bought a new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VW Passat<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from the folks at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Antwerpen VW<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (who gave me a great deal on a demo model).  So far, it&rsquo;s been a great ride (better gas mileage, more room, and better performance than the Jetta VR6 I&rsquo;d been driving about 6 years).</p>
<p>Having suffered through a couple of attempts to get my iPod to play through my old car (tape adaptor, iTrip), I looked forward to the opportunity to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;iPod my car&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I finally had it done yesterday.</p>

The technician who installed the iPod adaptor managed to disable my satellite radio.  It still receives channels and displays all the information, but there&rsquo;s no sound :-(<br>
They&rsquo;re going to be fixing that today.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The verdict<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
iPod integration is an improvement over the tape adapter, iTrip, or aux port options.  It&rsquo;s a bit pricey to install (around $350 for parts, labor, &amp; tax).  I&rsquo;ve got enough songs and podcasts on my iPod that when the included 3 months of XM expire, I probably won&rsquo;t miss them.  Going the aftermarket route was probably the only way to address my hangups about playlists and display information, but for now I prefer how seamless the current integration setup is.</p>

			 <p>Lockheed Martin&rsquo;s deal to buy Aspen Systems was finalized back in February, but until this week, the change hadn&rsquo;t really manifested itself in a noticeable way.  My colleagues and I have had more reports to write (since our bosses have had more reports to write), but not much else had changed until this week.</p>
<p>Yesterday we got an e-mail that our Aspen security badges were being replaced with Lockheed ones.  The old ones will be deactivated April 1.  Today we got an e-mail about company corporate cards we&rsquo;ll be required to use for business expenses from now on.  Bit by bit, the Aspen name and logo are disappearing from everything.  Yesterday, they replaced it on the intranet.  Today, the public website has the Lockheed Martin star on it (even though the title text still says Aspen Systems Corporation).</p>
<p>As I write this, there&rsquo;s a crane outside the building removing the Aspen Systems sign from the side of the building (the sign said &ldquo;pen Systems&rdquo; the last time I checked since they&rsquo;d only gotten 2 letters off).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting for more useful things to change, like intranet access, and software licenses for better tools.</p>

			 <p>This morning I came across <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that asks whether Windows Live is better than Google.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I blogged about Windows Live<!-- raw HTML omitted --> late last year and thought there were a couple of things that it did quite well.  The Technology Review article highlights the ability of Windows Live Search to launch multiple search panes in a single window.  No one should be particularly impressed by this because tabbed browsing has been a feature of Firefox and Opera for a really long time.  Internet Explorer 7 (which still isn&rsquo;t out yet) is the first version of Microsoft&rsquo;s browser that will actually have tabbed browsing built in.  The article also highlights the ability to view pictures at different sizes without leaving the search page, something Google has probably been doing for awhile already.</p>
<p>The article spends very little time on what is ultimately the most important thing about any search engine: relevant results.  Bells and whistles mean nothing if you don&rsquo;t get results you can use.  I&rsquo;ll do a side-by-side comparison for my own searches for a bit to see if Windows Live is giving me results as useful as Google&rsquo;s.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, I gave a presentation at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RSS, Podcasts, etc!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> workshop along with a colleague.  Our presentation isn&rsquo;t available on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NOAA&rsquo;s website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yet, but you can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->download it here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
<p>From what I saw and heard, NOAA, NASA, and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->US Geological Survey<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are the furthest along in implementing RSS feeds and podcasts.  Surprisingly enough, there are very few government agency blogs.  Even the one Aspen (now Lockheed Martin IT)  developed for ONDCP doesn&rsquo;t have an RSS feed yet.  There was very little use of blogging software to automate RSS feed generation.  A number of our fellow presenters talked about custom solutions on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LAMP<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stack that retrieved content from databases.</p>
<p>Our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->podcasting solution<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ONDCP<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the only one that used Microsoft technology.  The code we started with was a demo application including an Access database, a feed generation page, and a number of admin pages for adding, updating, and deleting RSS feed items.  Our customizations included the following:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The solution works reasonably well, but it isn&rsquo;t as fully-featured as WordPress or MovableType.  LMIT will be using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Community Server<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as part of the redesign of ONDCP&rsquo;s current blog, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pushingback.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  We&rsquo;re using version 1.1 on an extranet project I&rsquo;m managing and it&rsquo;s got tons of feature.  I think it&rsquo;s overkill for a single blog, but if ONDCP decides they want forum functionality, photo galleries, blog rolling, etc, Community Server gives them all that out of the box.</p>

			 <p>Before yesterday, I didn&rsquo;t know what I was missing.

But the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ASP.NET custom web controls talk<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I heard yesterday was a real eye-opener.

Stepping through actual code in the IDE and not just reading from the few slides he did have made it a very engaging presentation.

			 <p>An interesting title for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this story<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I read in the Times this morning.  The acquisition of my current employer (Aspen Systems) by Lockheed-Martin falls right in the area the story discusses (acquisitions of $100 million or more).  The buyout is scheduled to close shortly, so I expect to find out soon enough what Lockheed&rsquo;s plans are for us.</p>
<p>The idea of M &amp; A activity not always creating additional value has been around for awhile.  I remember reading stories like this in magazines like The Economist five or six years ago in the middle of the Internet bubble.  I&rsquo;ve only been working full-time for nine years or so, but I&rsquo;m sure questioning the value of mergers stretches back far before my time.</p>
<p>Since news of the buyout came to us, I&rsquo;ve been wondering what Lockheed sees in Aspen that they want.  Our annual revenue is a tiny fraction of Lockheed&rsquo;s.  As far as I can tell, the thing about Aspen that Lockheed most wanted was the subject-matter expertise.  A lot of the civilian agencies we do work for have essentially outsourced certain government offices to Aspen so we can act on their behalf.  So while we aren&rsquo;t an outsourcing power like IBM or EDS, we do occupy a similar niche.</p>
<p>I think Aspen gets plenty out of being bought Lockheed.  The first thing is deep pockets.  Even more important than the deep pockets is superior processes.  We just achieved CMMI level 2 last month, while parts of Lockheed have been at levels 3 through 5 for years.  Only time will tell if we help push the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LMT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stock symbol up.</p>

			 <p>This morning, when I was listening to the umpteenth radio story about the Justice Department subpoena of Google, it occurred to me that Google might know less about us than some other companies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use myself as an example.  I use Google for searching and Gmail for e-mail.  So they know what terms I&rsquo;ve searched for and when, along with who I&rsquo;ve sent e-mail to (and received e-mail from).  They could certainly know the contents of every e-mail if they wished.  The biggest potential risk to me of someone knowing what I&rsquo;ve e-mailed or searched for is embarassment.</p>
<p>Compare that to what credit bureaus can know about me.  TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax know at least the following:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>According to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this web page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, there&rsquo;s a long list of companies and people who can look at my credit report.  There are a lot of potential risks to me if I have a bad credit report:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At least Google lets you look at your recent search history.  The law only requires credit bureaus to give you free access to your credit report once a year.  After that, you have pay to get access.</p>
<p>Somehow, I&rsquo;m a lot less worried about how Google will use what they know about me.</p>

			 <p>Today is my 32nd birthday.  To me, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a particularly special birthday.  It isn&rsquo;t like turning 13, when you&rsquo;re finally a teenager, or 16 when you can drive, or 18 when you&rsquo;re officially an adult.  I remember being excited about turning 18 because I was finally old enough to vote.  I don&rsquo;t drink, but 21 was still a good birthday.  People talk about turning 25 as a milestone, but I feel 24 was a bigger year for me because I bought my townhouse that year.</p>
<p>Looking back over the past year, I see a lot of changes.  I finally got my MBA after 3 years of working full-time and school nearly full-time.  I made my first career change by leaving a full-time programming role and moving into project management.  Looking forward, I see the potential for more change.  The Lockheed-Martin buyout could change things completely.  I might start a business of my own this year, or get out of project management and into something else, like business development or strategy.</p>

			 <p>Richard Slade came up with a great <!-- raw HTML omitted -->list<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of free tools he thinks .NET developers should be using.  I first found out about test-driven development and NUnit a couple of years ago in a previous job.  It definitely improved the quality of my code.

<p>After this brief tutorial on building a database-backed website with Ruby on Rails, I like the  way it works.  While I didn&rsquo;t find the development process quite as simple as the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->screencasts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> portrayed it, I can definitely see using it as a rapid application prototyping tool.  Even with the hurdles posed by installing and configuring PHP and phpMyAdmin on top of learning Ruby and Rails, getting from page 1 to a completed application didn&rsquo;t take much time.</p>
<p>I still want to try out the Ruby plug-in for the Eclipse IDE to see how that compares with with SciTe and the command line.</p>

			 <p>I made it one of my resolutions to learn <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ruby<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this year, so I took a bit of time yesterday and today to try and get something working on my work laptop running Windows XP.  I&rsquo;d used the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one-click Windows installer for Ruby<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a week before, so I was able to use RubyGems to install Rails.  I put the latest version of MySQL on the laptop as well, since the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tutorial<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I&rsquo;m following uses it.</p>
<p>Instead of building the cookbook application the tutorial describes, I&rsquo;m trying to build an app that serves a database-driven RSS feed.  My reason is that we&rsquo;ve done this for a client project with some old ASP code and I wanted to compare architectures and level of effort.  So far, I like the way Ruby on Rails works.  You can create an empty web app just by typing &lsquo;rails <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; at a Windows prompt.  The application directory structure follows the model-view-controller design pattern, so there&rsquo;s no wondering about where to put certain types of code if you&rsquo;re familiar with the concept.  Generating stubs for controllers and models is also simple (&ldquo;ruby scriptgenerate controller <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; and &ldquo;ruby scriptgenerate model <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; in the web application folder respectively).</p>
<p>Development Ruby on Rails seems to go fastest if you follow their naming conventions for code, and the table names in MySQL.  When the model name is singular form of the database table name in plural form (recipe&ndash;&gt;recipes or podcast&ndash;&gt;podcasts), using   &ldquo;scaffold :<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; in your controller definition autogenerates the CRUD operations against that table in the database.  Making changes then becomes a simple database change exercise.  Once a column is added, moved, or removed from a table, just refreshing the browser shows the changes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably go back through the cookbook example and follow it step-for-step before going back to the podcast example, just so I have something stock that&rsquo;s working.  The other thing I plan to do is to replicate my work on the Mac mini I have at home.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I admit it&ndash;I&rsquo;m a C-SPAN junkie.  The purpose of the open phones topic this morning was to air people&rsquo;s opinions on how the Clinton presidency should be taught in middle and high school history classes.  As is usually the case with these shows, the callers didn&rsquo;t so much answer the question posed as bash George W. Bush or Bill Clinton.  The calls I found the strangest were the ones that blamed Clinton for the current Bush years and for how divided the country currently is.  Those opinions aside, my own is this: teach Clinton&rsquo;s successes and his failures&ndash;all of them.</p>
<p>I voted for Clinton both times.  Despite that, I don&rsquo;t consider him the best president ever, or even a great president&ndash;merely a good one.  In the success column: NAFTA, welfare reform, the economy.  Perot said plenty on the &ldquo;giant sucking sound&rdquo; of jobs leaving the U.S., and that&rsquo;s true.  But that has as much to do with companies not doing what was necessary to modernize as it does with lowering tariffs.  I remember being disappointed that Clinton signed the welfare reform bill, but in retrospect, it did get a lot of people off the welfare rolls.  Clinton should get credit for mostly staying out of the way as the economy recovered from downturn under the first Bush.  He should also get credit for increasing taxes on the highest earners in this country.  That contributed a lot to the government going from deficit to surplus.  I would count Clinton&rsquo;s actions on Bosnia as a success too, if only because he helped get NATO involved in stopping the slaughter of Muslims there.</p>
<p>In the failure column: healthcare reform, Rwanda, impeachment.  The failure of healthcare reform is perhaps the one with the most consequences for the present day.  The voices who said there was no healthcare crisis when Clinton was trying to get this passed are probably the same ones who passed the narrow, expensive and poorly-planned prescription drug benefit.  While Clinton isn&rsquo;t the only one to blame for the genocide in Rwanda (the whole world stood by on that one), as the leader of the greatest military power in the world, his government&rsquo;s inaction was very disappointing.  Impeachment ranks as the worst of his failures from an opportunity cost perspective, not just the moral one.  A lot of time was wasted that could have been spent doing far more useful things (like chasing al-Qaeda for example).  It allowed people to question his motives for trying to do what was ultimately the right thing.</p>

			 <p>My office gives us the day off tomorrow, but it&rsquo;s pretty much a ghost town already.  I had a bit of time today to play with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Windows Live Beta<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I was curious to see whether it was a step up compared to my.yahoo.com or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->google.com/ig<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>At first glance, live.com looks like a clone of Google&rsquo;s personalizable page (though live.com is even more streamlined).  It&rsquo;s easy to add content to the page, whether it&rsquo;s &ldquo;gadgets&rdquo; (the Google homepage calls them sections) or individual RSS feeds.</p>
<p>One particularly nice touch live.com has that I haven&rsquo;t found on Google yet is a way to import an OPML file.  To test it, I exported an OPML file from my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bloglines<!-- raw HTML omitted --> account and imported it into live.com.  Very quickly it showed up under &ldquo;My Stuff&rdquo; as &ldquo;Subscriptions&rdquo;.  From there, it was very simple to drag and drop individual RSS feeds onto my live.com home page.  I didn&rsquo;t realize right away that &ldquo;&gt;&gt;&rdquo; meant content would open in a new window, but once I did, I liked the functionality much better.  I wouldn&rsquo;t use this over bloglines right now, but I&rsquo;d be very interested to see if someone could come up with a slick gadget for newsreading.</p>
<p>A second convenient feature live.com provides is the ability to add the results of search to your home page.  It&rsquo;s like the News Alerts feature at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google News<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, only instead of sending you an e-mail, you see the results right on your page.</p>
<p>live.com seems to work equally well in Firefox or IE.  If I had to choose between google.com/ig and live.com right now, live.com has a slight edge in functionality.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve already got a Microsoft Passport (and/or a Hotmail account), live.com is worth trying out.</p>

			 <p>Last Friday, just before the end of the day, I found out that my current employer had been acquired.  The buyer: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lockheed-Martin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the multi-billion dollar defense contractor and member of the Fortune 50.  It&rsquo;s the second time I&rsquo;ve been part of a company that was acquired.</p>
<p>When I first heard the news, I thought back to previous employers.  At <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ciena<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we were the buyer.   I was there when they bought Catena Networks, Internet Photonics, WaveSmith, ONI Systems, and Akara.  I worried less when we were the buyer because it usually meant that any &ldquo;redundancies&rdquo; would favor Ciena employees over the acquired company.  Our managers and execs would always have meet with us to put the most positive spin on these moves.  The acquisitions were revenue plays of course.  When I left marchFIRST to join Ciena, it turned out that I had merely traded the Internet bubble implosion for the telecom bubble implosion.  We merely delayed the inevitable layoffs a bit longer.</p>
<p>MarchFIRST (the former USWeb/CKS) was a different story.  We got to be on both sides of the equation.  While I was there, we acquired a strategy firm, and sold out Whittman-Hart.  While it was spun as a &ldquo;merger of equals&rdquo; by the old CEO and the new one, it was as much a merger of equals as the DaimlerChrysler hookup (and even more of a failure, since not a shred of the combined firm exists anymore).</p>
<p>Since Aspen is so small (1700 employees to Lockheed&rsquo;s 130,000+), I feel plenty of uncertainty as to what will happen next.  Do they value Aspen as a single entity or will we be broken up?  Is this acquisition simply a purchase of people and contract vehicles or something more?  In the e-mail we got from our CEO, he said everyone would keep their jobs.  But I have my doubts that we&rsquo;ll keep two HR and accounting departments for any length of time.  What happens after those duplicated positions go away is what I wonder about.  I think it&rsquo;s likely that after 3-6 months, the best technology people will be cherry-picked for other spots in Lockheed-Martin IT.  I&rsquo;m not sure what that means for me, but I feel better about sticking around to find out than I might have otherwise.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, I got on a pair of skis for the first time since 8th grade.  A friend and I went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wisp<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to enjoy their cheap rentals and lift tickets (part of their 50th anniversary of operating).  It&rsquo;s a little weird to be an age where I can say I haven&rsquo;t done something in 15 years (it&rsquo;s actually 17 years, but who&rsquo;s counting).</p>
<p>Skiing is a bit more terrifying than I remember, but ultimately a fun experience.  After some initial awkwardness (ok, falling), I was able to get down a green run and a fairly challenging blue run in one piece.</p>
<p>There was one spill though, that introduced me to a new term: yard sale.  Apparently, if you crash on a ski slope in a way that separates you from both skis, both poles, and a hat, it&rsquo;s called a yard sale.  On a run named &ldquo;Boulder&rdquo; (which should have been renamed Steep Sheet of Ice), I missed a yard sale by hat.  Thankfully, I didn&rsquo;t have more than a headache after, and there were no cameras.</p>

In my own experiences with test-driven development over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve found it to be extremely helpful.  The code I&rsquo;ve written using this practice was quite a bit better than code written without it.  The primary objection I&rsquo;ve seen to using it is deadline pressure.  Some developers I&rsquo;ve worked with find it easier to develop test pages, since that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re used to.  The idea of writing code to help them design the finished product (instead of merely testing it) doesn&rsquo;t seem to appeal to them.</p>

			 <p>Trying to find some information about Bush&rsquo;s latest appointee to the Supreme Court, I found two comments especially troubling:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>— Artemus Ward, Northern Illinois University political science professor.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>For other reactions, see the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->full version of the article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (free registration required).</p>
<p>They are minority opinions to be sure, the bulk of the comments so far range from polite to unalloyed praise for Harriet Miers.  Still, I shudder at the mention of Clarence Thomas in connection to anything at all.  Few things in politics have made me more angry than his nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court.  Thurgood Marshall&rsquo;s record as a lawyer, his tenure as judge on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals (none of his 98 majority decisions was ever reversed), and his record as solicitor general of the United States (winning 14 of 19 cases he argued before the Supreme Court), stand in stark contrast to Thomas' brief and unremarkable tenure as an appeals court judge.  Thomas was notable only for being a black conservative (and his alleged conduct while head of the EEOC).  To replace a lion of civil rights like Thurgood Marshall with someone so opposed to what he&rsquo;d fought his whole life for was has always disappointed me.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sad is that Artemus Ward is probably correct.  Miers won&rsquo;t have enough of a paper trail for anyone to effectively oppose her&ndash;unless a significant amount of conservative reaction falls along the lines of Mr. Miranda&rsquo;s commentary.</p>

One recommendation he makes that&rsquo;s very useful is to treat warnings in managed code as errors.

<p>I checked out the Wall Street Journal this morning and sure enough, there was that word.  Checked the Washington Post, same thing.  Was the caller being overly sensitive? Maybe.  Was he reading some racial connotation into the use of the word?  Probably.  But it may also be that the press has been sloppy in how it uses words.  Usually you see the word &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in the context of someone fleeing another country from religious or political persecution.  The people in New Orleans aren&rsquo;t running from some dictator, they&rsquo;re from here.  They&rsquo;re just unfortunate enough to be too poor or too ill to get out of the way of the storm in time.</p>

As it turns out, they moved to Kochav Yaakov, in the West Bank.  There was a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->big feature<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the Baltimore Sun about it last month.</p>
<p>It certainly puts that conflict in a new light for me, now that someone I know is over there.  I respect Glenn for his courage and pray that he keeps safe.</p>

			 <p>Paul Krugman seems to believe so.  Check out his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->complete column<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the New York Times online (free registration required).</p>
<p>I live in what Krugman describes as the &ldquo;Zoned Zone&rdquo;, a few miles north of D.C. in Wheaton, Maryland.  While a townhouse in my neighborhood recently sold for about $400,000, it took 2-3 weeks.  I think they started out asking for $450,000 and had to drop the price some.  Another bit of information I got, which supports Krugman&rsquo;s idea somewhat, is a conversation I had with a realtor a month or two ago.  He was essentially trolling my neighborhood for people interested in selling their townhouses and I asked him about some new ones being built (a 5-10 minute walk from my townhouse).  He said the price tags on those went as high as $800,000, but that the builders were having to rent them out because they couldn&rsquo;t sell them at that price.</p>
<p>Between this information and the increasing popularity of interest-only loans, real estate prices have to come back to earth sooner or later.</p>

			 <p>All the papers, projects, PowerPoint presentations and spreadsheets of three years in the University of Maryland part-time MBA program fits comes to just under 188 megabytes worth of files.  Somehow I expected it to take up more space.</p>
<p>Regardless of the ultimate file size of all that work, my reason for getting an MBA was to gain enough knowledge to change careers.      Even when I was getting my computer science degree (from 1992-1996), I figured I had maybe 10 years to write code full-time before I would want (or need) to do something else.  The MBA as a degree takes plenty of flack from many angles.  People with this degree take the blame for the dot-com bust.  FedEx has a commercial that makes a joke at the expense of MBAs.  There&rsquo;s plenty to read in print and on the web about how the MBA is a waste of time.  Speaking only for myself, the degree was worth it.</p>
<p>The degree got me my current job.  Instead of writing code everyday, I manage projects (and the people assigned to them), their requirements, budgets and schedules.  I still write code from time-to-time (more often lately since we&rsquo;ve got a website launching this Friday), but I spend more time on design.  Occasionally I&rsquo;ll have to negotiate a software purchase or interview potential new hires.  There&rsquo;s too much to do for the job to become &ldquo;routine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Could I do all this without an MBA?  Sure.  But the odds that a company where no one knows me would give me the chance to try all these things are pretty low.  And without the prior exposure to topics like accounting, strategy, and negotiation, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do my job as well.  Beyond the things I learned in classes and the connections I made with classmates, I saw the MBA as a way to signal to potential employers that I was interested in more responsibility&ndash;that I wanted to become a decision-maker.</p>

			 <p>My boss wanted to use it to track issues with projects we develop internally and for clients. So I downloaded it, installed it, and began testing. So far, any problems we&rsquo;ve had have been the result of missing database tables and/or stored procedures. What&rsquo;s odd is that I&rsquo;ve been able to find create commands for all the missing database objects in CreateDatabaseObjects.sql (located in ..ASP.NET Starter KitsIssueTrackerSetupDBScripts). I guess there&rsquo;s something wrong with the script, because every other aspect of the setup seemed to work just fine.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of what I&rsquo;ve had to add manually so far:</p>
<h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
<p>IssueTracker_IssueAttachments</p>
<h2 id="stored-procedures">Stored Procedures</h2>
<p>IssueTracker_Project_CloneProject
IssueTracker_IssueAttachment_GetIssueAttachmentsByIssueId
IssueTracker_IssueAttachment_CreateNewIssueAttachment
IssueTracker_IssueAttachment_GetIssueAttachmentById</p>
<p>I also replaced the query in the stored procedure IssueTracker_Issue_GetIssuesByProjectId with the query of the same name from the Access database. It referred to a view named IssueTracker_IssueStatus that wasn&rsquo;t in the database or CreateDatabaseObjects.sql.</p>

			 <p>The Mac mini I ordered online back in February finally arrived tonight.  The only real problem I&rsquo;ve encountered so far is that it had trouble detecting my Linksys router from upstairs.  What I&rsquo;m not certain of is whether this was because I had MAC address filtering enabled initially.  Once I disabled that and set everything up closer to the wireless router, Internet access worked fine.</p>
<p>Software installs were very simple.  For the most part, I&rsquo;d just download a file and drag it to the applications folder.  Very easy, very clean.</p>
<p>I still have plenty of configuration work left to do though.  If the mini can&rsquo;t access the Internet wirelessly from a distance, I may spring for an Airport Express to see if that will boost the signal enough. If I can get a DVI cable, Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for less than the Airport Express, it may be worth it to hook it up to my HDTV &amp; stereo instead.</p>
<p>Networking it with my Win2K server will be another challenge.</p>
<p>Update: I moved the mini upstairs and turned everything on again.  Now it&rsquo;s connecting wirelessly with no trouble at all.</p>

			 <p>From the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: America needs people who have &ldquo;the moral clarity and courage to do what&rsquo;s right, regardless of consequence, fashion or fad,&rdquo; Karl Rove said.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->What he said is quite true.  It would have been more honest for him to say that the U.S. government needs people with moral clarity and courage.  The irony of Karl Rove being the one to say this is readily apparent to anyone who follows the news.  In his capacity as Bush&rsquo;s chief political strategist, he has advocated incredibly dishonest treatment of his boss' opponents, Republican or Democrat.  The way Bush campaigned against John McCain was any thing but morally clear and courageous.  His current campaign for re-election is no different.  Distortions and outright lies about the stands of his opponent and an inability to admit mistakes are anything but morally clear and courageous.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->America certainly does need people with moral clarity and courage to do what&rsquo;s right.  But finding such people in our government seems like finding the proverbial needle in a haystack.  The best we can hope to do as individuals is to develop these traits ourselves.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s any problem I have with the column, it&rsquo;s the idea that &ldquo;scientism&rdquo; has no use whatsoever. Implicit in that argument is a defense of the creation of a new intelligence unit within the Pentagon. They operated on the sort of intuition that Brooks advocates. But without the sort of processes and actual intelligence know-how that exists in the CIA and elsewhere, intelligence information of dubious credibility was put forward as fact.</p>
<p>While relying solely on &ldquo;scientism&rdquo; to predict and stop threats isn&rsquo;t the best idea, neither is turning to the other extreme (going exclusively with your gut, or instinct).</p>

<p>Now that David Kay&rsquo;s report has stated that they&rsquo;ve found no weapons, and likely never will, Scott Ritter has been completely vindicated. Though their motives may not have been the best, one could say that the French were right as well.</p>
<p>Especially interesting in the Brian Lamb interview was Ritter&rsquo;s response to a caller who suggested the idea of impeachment. He said the right things about having all the facts, and due process. In addition, he laid out a pretty strong case that Dick Cheney might be guilty of fraud, if he knew some statements he made prior the war to a VFW gathering regarding an Iraqi defector were false.</p>
<p>I especially appreciated the way Ritter placed blame at the feet of Congress for giving the president a free hand to go to war. I&rsquo;ve always believed that Congress abdicated its responsibility in doing so.</p>
<p>The other valid point he made was that the United States needs to be a fully active member of the UN in order to prevent Iraq from descending fully into chaos. To him, bringing the UN into Iraq did not mean the US completely exiting Iraq.</p>
<p>Overall, a number of the points Ritter made about the war sounded like things Howard Dean has said on the election trail, most importantly that the US isn&rsquo;t safer as a result of the war in Iraq. Interestingly enough, despite being a self-described &ldquo;moderate conservative&rdquo;, Ritter said he was going to devote all of his efforts to getting Bush defeated, despite voting for him in 2000. Hearing more from Ritter in the press about Iraq would be a good thing, especially as the election gets closer.</p>

<p>To me, it&rsquo;s just one more decision that says we don&rsquo;t have the first clue about what real science is.  I still remember some of the debate over &ldquo;super-conducting super-collider&rdquo; vs. the International Space Station.  At that time, it seemed clear to me that the likelihood of useful scientific discovery occurring was a lot lower with the ISS than with super-collider.  But because it was in Texas, the Dems were in power, and they wanted to stick it to the GOP, the wrong project got killed.</p>
<p>History may not repeat itself exactly, but it sure does rhyme.</p>

<p>Great essay by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Peter Norvig<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that begins by talking about the &ldquo;Learn topic X in Y Days&rdquo; publishing phenomenon, and counters with how long it really takes.</p>
<p>His recipe for programming success, and his contention that it takes 10 years to get really good at it both make a lot of sense.  Since getting my computer science degree from the University of Maryland (in 1996), the things I&rsquo;ve learned about programming from doing it for a living have really added a lot to my understanding of what I was taught in school.</p>
<p>Working on projects with other programmers is what I enjoy most.  I definitely feel like I learn more and accomplish more when I work with a team.  Unfortunately, the position I&rsquo;ve had the past couple of years means that I have to develop everything by myself.  I&rsquo;ve certainly learned a lot from not having other people to depend on, but I think teams develop the best software.</p>
<p>Working on projects after other programmers has been one of the most frustrating parts of my career.  Too often, it&rsquo;s poorly documented and written in an &ldquo;ensure job security&rdquo; sort of way.  In other words, it&rsquo;s not written in a way that easily allows someone else to understand it.  Programmers only get away with that if they&rsquo;re working by themselves.  More often than not, if I&rsquo;m confronted with that situation, I&rsquo;ll rewrite the application instead of spending a lot of effort deciphering the existing code.</p>
<p>Talking to other programmers about programming is something I don&rsquo;t do enough of.  Finding time to read other good code is a challenge (trying to balance full-time work and a part-time MBA program), but I need to do that as well.</p>

<p>A Lawrence Lessig article on customer-owned networks. He uses examples from Boeing Corporation and the city government of Burlington, Vermont. Governments, corporations, and individuals (if they have sufficient funds) buying networks definitely has some benefits. No more worrying about Comcast being the only way to get onto the internet. The knowledge that a municipality could hire contractors to build such a network themselves could also work as an incentive to spur competition (if corporations are being too slow about providing access to certain areas). I hope more cities and counties do this.</p>

<p>I found the following note:</p>
<p>Note: Do not preface your stored procedure names with sp_, because doing so reduces performance. When you call a stored procedure that starts with sp_, SQL Server always checks the master database first, even if the stored procedure is qualified with the database name:</p>

<p>I attended this presentation last Wednesday. If you ever do presentations for work, your MBA program, or anything else, attending this presentation is the best money you&rsquo;ll ever spend. The fee includes a copy of all three of his books, and he refers to them often during the presentation. If there are two key points that can be summarized from the entire day, they would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Paper is a much higher-resolution medium for communicating information than a computer screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only overhead projectors are worse for communicating information than PowerPoint.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Tufte does an excellent of substantiating each of these points. He illustrated the second point in hilarious fashion by showing us The Gettysburg Powerpoint Presentation, courtesy of Peter Norvig (and the Microsoft Powerpoint AutoContent Wizard).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll include my notes from the course in a future post, but attending it in person is the best way to get the full effect.</p>

<p>A basic Google <!-- raw HTML omitted -->search <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will reveal all kinds of pages of information about Edward Tufte and his ideas&ndash;including notes other people have written about their experiences during his presentation. Looking at those will give you a broad picture.</p>
<p>My notes from the presentation are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>6000+ year history of trying to communicate 3 or more dimensions of info in 2 dimensions (paper, computer screens)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data density and increased resolution are other issues with presenting data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendation: put the data directly on the chart, don&rsquo;t shove it into a legend</p>
<p>Rules of analytical design</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Show comparisons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show causality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show multivariable data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate words, numbers, &amp; images</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document everything and show documentation (sources). Don&rsquo;t trust people who fail to provide documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens in a presentation depends on the quality, integrity, and relevance of the content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to make important comparisons adjacent in space instead of stacked in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use small multiples. They are comparative, multi-variate, and adjacent in space. Repetition, in time-series, increases credibility and integrity of presentation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Napoleon&rsquo;s March<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (originally an anti-war poster, according to Tufte)</p>
<p>Dimensions of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>size of army</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>location (3 dimensions)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>temperature</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>6 dimensions of data in only 2 dimensions (paper)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should our work show the chaos of the bureaucracy that produced it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Principles of analystical design are the same as those of analytical thinking.</p>
<p>Good design is clear thinking made visible. Unfortunately, the converse is true.</p>
<p>Recommendations: Get a Mac. Get a big, high-res monitor. Even better, multiple screens.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t de-quantify data. In page 31 of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Envisioning Information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the chart would be better if the X&rsquo;s were replaced by the number of occurrences of the crime.</p>
<p>Edward Tufte is working on a 4th book which should be out this year (he self-publishes).</p>
<p>You must show scales of measurement.</p>
<p>If you have data with high periodicity, consider carefully the vertical scale of your data. Smoother data can reveal trends that &ldquo;spikey&rdquo; data can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Side note: when sewage gets into drinking water, cholera can result. This comes from a discussion of process of stopping a cholera epidemic in London, and the way data was used to determine the source.</p>
<p>Make small, but effective differences. This brings out more info.</p>
<p>Defend your content against a production process that might mess it up.</p>
<p>Borrow strong design (don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Displaying Financial Data<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally an assessment of change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show averages and variation. Detail increases credibility. Clutter and confusion are design failures. Micro-macro design is a good idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When comparing money &amp; time over more than a year, you must adjust for inflation so comparisons will be correct. Annual reports typically don&rsquo;t do this, so their data in tables &amp; graphs is wrong. Data needs to be adjusted for seasonal effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t trust a display with no footnotes. Footnotes help credibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial data should explain as well as describe. Annotation is a good tool for accomplishing this. Every table &amp; graphic in a presentation should be annotated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find and follow great conventions of displaying financial data. Borrow strength. Don&rsquo;t be constrained by time or geography in your search for examples to borrow.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider what thinking task the analytical display is supposed to help.</p>
<p>Regression toward the mean is a statistical fact. So you must separate that from other possibilities when trying to use data to make public policy.</p>
<p>Recency bias is the tendency of people to give more weight to the most recent data.</p>
<p>Spark lines are a Tufte invention for displaying financial (or similar) data. They display better on paper than on a computer screen.</p>
<p>Design should not reproduce the hierarchy. It shouldn&rsquo;t reproduce bureaucracy. Don&rsquo;t reproduce binary searches.</p>
<p>Design should be as flat as possible. Should depend on scanning of reader&rsquo;s eye, not scrolling. Sites like GoogleNews and Yahoo and other portals are successful because they cram lots of info into the first screen.</p>
<p>Paper is: permanent, high resolution, portable</p>
<p>&ldquo;Users should never see an operating system.&rdquo; (Edward Tufte) On the shop floor, and in military environments, user interfaces are devoted entirely to content.</p>
<p>Screen should be 90% content in web design. You don&rsquo;t need more than a nav bar to navigate a website.</p>
<p>Side Note: Edward Tufte loves the iBook G4. The MacOS is ok, though he doesn&rsquo;t like the dock because it reveals the OS.</p>
<p>Microsoft bought a company that developed an app called Presenter in 1984. The app became PowerPoint. A software corporation is its underlying metaphor (structured, nested, hierarchical, short lines). It is presenter-oriented, not audience-oriented.</p>
<p>Powerpoint&rsquo;s problem is that it&rsquo;s low-res. the bullet points are a big problem too.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t abbreviate the truth to fit on a slide. Find a better presentation method.</p>
<p>An 11x17&quot; piece of paper can hold the same amount of information as 250 PowerPoint slides. Feel free to use PowerPoint to display really expensive graphics (that would be cost-prohibitive).</p>
<p>Bell Centennial is both highly readable and highly condensed. Great for use in serious printing situations.</p>
<p>Solid rocket boosters are built in Utah, assembled in Florida. The post-manufacture assembly is what makes O-rings necessary.</p>
<p>Lessons to Learn from Challenger Disaster Presentation</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Show me causality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show me all relevant evidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask yourself: what do I really need to see?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These 3 things improve the chances of making the right decision. Tables should have numbers and words in them.</p>
<p>Supporting material can be found here.</p>
<p>Techniques for Better Presentations</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Show up early. Good for giving handouts and getting to know your audience individually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problem, relevance, solution. Your presentation must have these elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never apologize in your intro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Particular, general, particular. This pattern can be used to present slide information (instead of just reading the slide).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about your audience by what they read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Gettysburg Address (what not to do)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The audience is precious. Treat them accordingly, don&rsquo;t patronize. Consider them colleagues. Be civil and diplomatic, but don&rsquo;t self-censor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humor is good. But don&rsquo;t be generic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use masculine pronouns universally. Feel free to use plurals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hide behind the podium. Believe in what you&rsquo;re presenting, and be demonstrative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finish early.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Outside the Meeting</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Practice, practice, practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice in front of a friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice in front of a video camera (so you can pick up any habitual gestures or movements, stutters, use of the word &ldquo;um&rdquo;, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get better presentation content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
